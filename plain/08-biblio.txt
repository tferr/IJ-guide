Abstract
Although Western blots are frequently quantified, densitometry is not documented and appears to be based merely on traditions and guesswork. Confirming previous experience, none of 100 randomly selected and systematically scanned most recent papers provided sufficient information on how Western blot results were translated into statistical values. The importance of such information, however, becomes evident from our correlations of plasma erythropoietin values of various mammals determined using RIA and Western blot densitometry. Different common densitometry procedures applied to the identical Western blot revealed p-values of these correlations ranging from 0.000013 to 0.76 reflecting the necessity of a scientifically sound basis for densitometry of Western blots. At present, the current lack of any definitions in densitometry opens the door to uncontrollable acquisition of any desired p-value. Here we provide data that define what should be considered, what avoided and what documented when quantifying Western blots.

Abstract
Precise three-dimensional (3D) mapping of a large number of gene expression patterns, neuronal types and connections to an anatomical reference helps us to understand the vertebrate brain and its development. We developed the Virtual Brain Explorer (ViBE-Z), a software that automatically maps gene expression data with cellular resolution to a 3D standard larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain. ViBE-Z enhances the data quality through fusion and attenuation correction of multiple confocal microscope stacks per specimen and uses a fluorescent stain of cell nuclei for image registration. It automatically detects 14 predefined anatomical landmarks for aligning new data with the reference brain. ViBE-Z performs colocalization analysis in expression databases for anatomical domains or subdomains defined by any specific pattern; here we demonstrate its utility for mapping neurons of the dopaminergic system. The ViBE-Z database, atlas and software are provided via a web interface.

Abstract
Few technologies are more widespread in modern biological laboratories than imaging. Recent advances in optical technologies and instrumentation are providing hitherto unimagined capabilities. Almost all these advances have required the development of software to enable the acquisition, management, analysis and visualization of the imaging data. We review each computational step that biologists encounter when dealing with digital images, the inherent challenges and the overall status of available software for bioimage informatics, focusing on open-source options.

Abstract
Fiji is a distribution of the popular open-source software ImageJ focused on biological-image analysis. Fiji uses modern software engineering practices to combine powerful software libraries with a broad range of scripting languages to enable rapid prototyping of image-processing algorithms. Fiji facilitates the transformation of new algorithms into ImageJ plugins that can be shared with end users through an integrated update system. We propose Fiji as a platform for productive collaboration between computer science and biology research communities.

Abstract
In the field of neuroanatomy, automatic segmentation of electron microscopy images is becoming one of the main limiting factors in getting new insights into the functional structure of the brain. We propose a novel framework for the segmentation of thin elongated structures like membranes in a neuroanatomy setting. The probability output of a random forest classifier is used in a regular cost function, which enforces gap completion via perceptual grouping constraints. The global solution is efficiently found by graph cut optimization. We demonstrate substantial qualitative and quantitative improvement over state-of the art segmentations on two considerably different stacks of ssTEM images as well as in segmentations of streets in satellite imagery. We demonstrate that the superior performance of our method yields fully automatic 3D reconstructions of dendrites from ssTEM data.

Abstract
MOTIVATION: Tiled serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) is increasingly used to describe high-resolution anatomy of large biological specimens. In particular in neurobiology, TEM is indispensable for analysis of synaptic connectivity in the brain. Registration of ssTEM image mosaics has to recover the 3D continuity and geometrical properties of the specimen in presence of various distortions that are applied to the tissue during sectioning, staining and imaging. These include staining artifacts, mechanical deformation, missing sections and the fact that structures may appear dissimilar in consecutive sections.

RESULTS: We developed a fully automatic, non-rigid but as-rigid-as-possible registration method for large tiled serial section microscopy stacks. We use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to identify corresponding landmarks within and across sections and globally optimize the pose of all tiles in terms of least square displacement of these landmark correspondences. We evaluate the precision of the approach using an artificially generated dataset designed to mimic the properties of TEM data. We demonstrate the performance of our method by registering an ssTEM dataset of the first instar larval brain of Drosophila melanogaster consisting of 6885 images.

AVAILABILITY: This method is implemented as part of the open source software TrakEM2 (http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2.html) and distributed through the Fiji project (http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de).

Abstract
Neurobiologists address neural structure, development, and function at the level of "macrocircuits" (how different brain compartments are interconnected; what overall pattern of activity they produce) and at the level of "microcircuits" (how connectivity and physiology of individual neurons and their processes within a compartment determine the functional output of this compartment). Work in our lab aims at reconstructing the developing Drosophila brain at both levels. Macrocircuits can be approached conveniently by reconstructing the pattern of brain lineages, which form groups of neurons whose projections form cohesive fascicles interconnecting the compartments of the larval and adult brain. The reconstruction of microcircuits requires serial section electron microscopy, due to the small size of terminal neuronal processes and their synaptic contacts. Because of the amount of labor that traditionally comes with this approach, very little is known about microcircuitry in brains across the animal kingdom. Many of the problems of serial electron microscopy reconstruction are now solvable with digital image recording and specialized software for both image acquisition and postprocessing. In this chapter, we introduce our efforts to reconstruct the small Drosophila larval brain and discuss our results in light of the published data on neuropile ultrastructure in other animal taxa.

Abstract
Changes in blood vessel diameter can be measured manually, but this is time-consuming and often impractical. For automatic measurement commercial solutions are available, but the proprietary algorithms and their potential shortcomings are not known to the user. We present an approach with a CCD camera for image acquisition combined with free and open source ImageJ software for offline analysis. A subtraction image allows for the evaluation of the diameter changes throughout the field of view. A full width at half-maximum algorithm plug-in was written to measure the vessel diameter. For a given line across a vessel, the results of five measurements with parallel shifts throughout an image stack are copied to the clipboard. For validation of this method an established in vivo model was used, namely vascular changes in the rat dura mater, reflecting the activity of the afferent neurons. Vasoconstriction of the meningeal arterioles induced by local electrical stimulation of the dura was inhibited by intravenous administration of the adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine and amplified by the CGRP receptor antagonist olcegepant. The described methods allow the user to quickly evaluate vessel diameter changes in the whole acquired field at any selected position.

Abstract
Studies of axonal transport are critical, not only to understand its normal regulation, but also to determine the roles of transport impairment in disease. Exciting new resources have recently become available allowing live imaging of axonal transport in physiologically relevant settings, such as mammalian nerves. Thus the effects of disease, ageing and therapies can now be assessed directly in nervous system tissue. However, these imaging studies present new challenges. Manual or semi-automated analysis of the range of transport parameters required for a suitably complete evaluation is very time-consuming and can be subjective due to the complexity of the particle movements in axons in ex vivo explants or in vivo. We have developed Difference Tracker, a program combining two new plugins for the ImageJ image-analysis freeware, to provide fast, fully automated and objective analysis of a number of relevant measures of trafficking of fluorescently labeled particles so that axonal transport in different situations can be easily compared. We confirm that Difference Tracker can accurately track moving particles in highly simplified, artificial simulations. It can also identify and track multiple motile fluorescently labeled mitochondria simultaneously in time-lapse image stacks from live imaging of tibial nerve axons, reporting values for a number of parameters that are comparable to those obtained through manual analysis of the same axons. Difference Tracker therefore represents a useful free resource for the comparative analysis of axonal transport under different conditions, and could potentially be used and developed further in many other studies requiring quantification of particle movements.

Abstract
With the advent of digital cameras and motorization of mechanical components, computer control of microscopes has become increasingly important. Software for microscope image acquisition should not only be easy to use, but also enable and encourage novel approaches. The open-source software package µManager aims to fulfill those goals. This unit provides step-by-step protocols describing how to get started working with µManager, as well as some starting points for advanced use of the software.

Abstract
Bone geometry is commonly measured on computed tomographic (CT) and X-ray microtomographic (μCT) images. We obtained hundreds of CT, μCT and synchrotron μCT images of bones from diverse species that needed to be analysed remote from scanning hardware, but found that available software solutions were expensive, inflexible or methodologically opaque. We implemented standard bone measurements in a novel ImageJ plugin, BoneJ, with which we analysed trabecular bone, whole bones and osteocyte lacunae. BoneJ is open source and free for anyone to download, use, modify and distribute.

Abstract
Individuals with red-green colour-blindness (CB) commonly experience great difficulty differentiating between certain histological stain pairs, notably haematoxylin-eosin (HE). The prevalence of red-green CB is high (6-10% of males), including among medical and laboratory personnel, and raises two major concerns: first, accessibility and equity issues during the education and training of individuals with this disability, and second, the likelihood of errors in critical tasks such as interpreting histological images. Here we show two methods to enhance images of HE-stained samples so the differently stained tissues can be well discriminated by red-green CBs while remaining usable by people with normal vision. Method 1 involves rotating and stretching the range of HE hues in the image to span the perceptual range of the CB observers. Method 2 digitally unmixes the original dyes using colour deconvolution into two separate images and repositions the information into hues that are more distinctly perceived. The benefits of these methods were tested in 36 volunteers with normal vision and 11 with red-green CB using a variety of HE stained tissue sections paired with their enhanced versions. CB subjects reported they could better perceive the different stains using the enhanced images for 85% of preparations (method 1: 90%, method 2: 73%), compared to the HE-stained original images. Many subjects with normal vision also preferred the enhanced images to the original HE. The results suggest that these colour manipulations confer considerable advantage for those with red-green colour vision deficiency while not disadvantaging people with normal colour vision.

Abstract
The analysis of microcircuitry (the connectivity at the level of individual neuronal processes and synapses), which is indispensable for our understanding of brain function, is based on serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or one of its modern variants. Due to technical limitations, most previous studies that used serial TEM recorded relatively small stacks of individual neurons. As a result, our knowledge of microcircuitry in any nervous system is very limited. We applied the software package TrakEM2 to reconstruct neuronal microcircuitry from TEM sections of a small brain, the early larval brain of Drosophila melanogaster. TrakEM2 enables us to embed the analysis of the TEM image volumes at the microcircuit level into a light microscopically derived neuro-anatomical framework, by registering confocal stacks containing sparsely labeled neural structures with the TEM image volume. We imaged two sets of serial TEM sections of the Drosophila first instar larval brain neuropile and one ventral nerve cord segment, and here report our first results pertaining to Drosophila brain microcircuitry. Terminal neurites fall into a small number of generic classes termed globular, varicose, axiform, and dendritiform. Globular and varicose neurites have large diameter segments that carry almost exclusively presynaptic sites. Dendritiform neurites are thin, highly branched processes that are almost exclusively postsynaptic. Due to the high branching density of dendritiform fibers and the fact that synapses are polyadic, neurites are highly interconnected even within small neuropile volumes. We describe the network motifs most frequently encountered in the Drosophila neuropile. Our study introduces an approach towards a comprehensive anatomical reconstruction of neuronal microcircuitry and delivers microcircuitry comparisons between vertebrate and insect neuropile.

ABSTRACT : Biologists can now prepare and image thousands of samples per day using automation, enabling chemical screens and functional genomics (for example, using RNA interference). Here we describe the first free, open-source system designed for flexible, high-throughput cell image analysis, CellProfiler. CellProfiler can address a variety of biological questions quantitatively, including standard assays (for example, cell count, size, per-cell protein levels) and complex morphological assays (for example, cell/organelle shape or subcellular patterns of DNA or protein staining).

Abstract
Advances in imaging techniques and high-throughput technologies are providing scientists with unprecedented possibilities to visualize internal structures of cells, organs and organisms and to collect systematic image data characterizing genes and proteins on a large scale. To make the best use of these increasingly complex and large image data resources, the scientific community must be provided with methods to query, analyze and crosslink these resources to give an intuitive visual representation of the data. This review gives an overview of existing methods and tools for this purpose and highlights some of their limitations and challenges.

Abstract
Acquisition data and treatments for quality controls of gamma cameras and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) cameras are commonly performed with dedicated program packages, which are running only on manufactured computers and differ from each other, depending on camera company and program versions. The aim of this work was to develop a free open-source program (written in JAVA language) to analyze data for quality control of gamma cameras and PET cameras. The program is based on the free application software ImageJ and can be easily loaded on any computer operating system (OS) and thus on any type of computer in every nuclear medicine department. Based on standard parameters of quality control, this program includes 1) for gamma camera: a rotation center control (extracted from the American Association of Physics in Medicine, AAPM, norms) and two uniformity controls (extracted from the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, IPEM, and National Electronic Manufacturers Association, NEMA, norms). 2) For PET systems, three quality controls recently defined by the French Medical Physicist Society (SFPM), i.e. spatial resolution and uniformity in a reconstructed slice and scatter fraction, are included. The determination of spatial resolution (thanks to the Point Spread Function, PSF, acquisition) allows to compute the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) in both modalities of cameras. All the control functions are included in a tool box which is a free ImageJ plugin and could be soon downloaded from Internet. Besides, this program offers the possibility to save on HTML format the uniformity quality control results and a warning can be set to automatically inform users in case of abnormal results. The architecture of the program allows users to easily add any other specific quality control program. Finally, this toolkit is an easy and robust tool to perform quality control on gamma cameras and PET cameras based on standard computation parameters, is free, run on any type of computer and will soon be downloadable from the net (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins or http://nucleartoolkit.free.fr).

Abstract
A machine vision ImageJ plugin was developed in Java for orthogonal length and width determination of singulated particles from digital images. A flatbed scanner obtained the digital images of particulate samples. The "pixel-march" method, which compared pixel colors to determine object boundaries for dimensional measurements, utilized only the ImageJ fitted-ellipse centroid coordinates and major axis inclination. The pixel-march started from objects centroid and proceeded along the fitted-ellipses' major and minor axes for boundary identification. Actual dimensions of selected reference particles measured using digital calipers validated the plugin. The plugin was applied to measure orthogonal dimensions of eight types of food grains. The plugin has overall accuracy greater than 96.6%, computation speed of 254 +/- 125 particles/s, handles all shapes and particle orientations, makes repeatable measurements, and is economical. Applications of developed plugin may include routine laboratory dimensional measurements, physical dimensional characteristics, size based grading, and sieve analysis simulation for particle size distribution.

Abstract
We present an interactive approach to the pseudo-colouring of greyscale images. We implement the technique by computing mappings from a three-dimensional (3D) colour space to a one-dimensional greyscale space (i.e. R-3 to R). To compute our maps, we employ both linear and nonlinear interpolation in 3D colour space. We validate our work by applying our maps to greyscale images resulting in significant image enhancement. Applications include space imagery, geological topographies, medical scans and many more. Our tool is coded as a Java plug-in for the open source image processing package, ImageJ.

Abstract
We developed image presentation software that mimics the functionality available in the clinic, but also records time-stamped, observer-display interactions and is readily deployable on diverse workstations making it possible to collect comparable observer data at multiple sites. Commercial image presentation software for clinical use has limited application for research on image perception, ergonomics, computer-aids and informatics because it does not collect observer responses, or other information on observer-display interactions, in real time. It is also very difficult to collect observer data from multiple institutions unless the same commercial software is available at different sites. Our software not only records observer reports of abnormalities and their locations, but also inspection time until report, inspection time for each computed radiograph and for each slice of tomographic studies, window/level, and magnification settings used by the observer. The software is a modified version of the open source ImageJ software available from the National Institutes of Health. Our software involves changes to the base code and extensive new plugin code. Our free software is currently capable of displaying computed tomography and computed radiography images. The software is packaged as Java class files and can be used on Windows, Linux, or Mac systems. By deploying our software together with experiment-specific script files that administer experimental procedures and image file handling, multi-institutional studies can be conducted that increase reader and/or case sample sizes or add experimental conditions.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: For the investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in neurite outgrowth and differentiation, accurate and reproducible segmentation and quantification of neuronal processes are a prerequisite. To facilitate this task, we developed a semiautomatic neurite tracing technique. This article describes the design and validation of the technique. METHODS: The technique was compared to fully manual delineation. Four observers repeatedly traced selected neurites in 20 fluorescence microscopy images of cells in culture, using both methods. Accuracy and reproducibility were determined by comparing the tracings to high-resolution reference tracings, using two error measures. Labor intensiveness was measured in numbers of mouse clicks required. The significance of the results was determined by a Student t-test and by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Both methods slightly underestimated the true neurite length, but the differences were not unanimously significant. The average deviation from the true neurite centerline was a factor 2.6 smaller with the developed technique compared to fully manual tracing. Intraobserver variability in the respective measures was reduced by a factor 6.0 and 23.2. Interobserver variability was reduced by a factor 2.4 and 8.8, respectively, and labor intensiveness by a factor 3.3. CONCLUSIONS: Providing similar accuracy in measuring neurite length, significantly improved accuracy in neurite centerline extraction, and significantly improved reproducibility and reduced labor intensiveness, the developed technique may replace fully manual tracing methods.

Abstract
At the most fundamental level, all digital images are just large arrays of numbers that can easily be manipulated by computer software. Specialized digital imaging software packages often use routines common to many different applications and fields of study. The freely available, platform independent, image-processing package ImageJ has many such functions. We highlight ImageJ's capabilities by presenting methods of processing sequences of images to produce a star trail image and a single high quality planetary image.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: Transmission electron tomography is an increasingly common three-dimensional electron microscopy approach that can provide new insights into the structure of subcellular components. Transmission electron tomography fills the gap between high resolution structural methods (X-ray diffraction or nuclear magnetic resonance) and optical microscopy. We developed new software for transmission electron tomography, TomoJ. TomoJ is a plug-in for the now standard image analysis and processing software for optical microscopy, ImageJ. RESULTS: TomoJ provides a user-friendly interface for alignment, reconstruction, and combination of multiple tomographic volumes and includes the most recent algorithms for volume reconstructions used in three-dimensional electron microscopy (the algebraic reconstruction technique and simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique) as well as the commonly used approach of weighted back-projection. CONCLUSION: The software presented in this work is specifically designed for electron tomography. It has been written in Java as a plug-in for ImageJ and is distributed as freeware.

Abstract
Aims: To develop a flexible and fast colony forming unit quantification method that can be operated in a standard microbiology laboratory.Methods and Results: A miniaturized plating method is reported where droplets of bacterial cultures are spotted on agar plates. Subsequently, minicolony spots are imaged with a digital camera and quantified using a dedicated plug-in developed for the freeware program IMAGEJ. A comparison between conventional and minicolony plating of industrial micro-organisms including lactic acid bacteria, Eschericha coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that there was no significant difference in the results obtained with the methods.Conclusions: The presented method allows downscaling of plating by 100-fold, is flexible, easy-to-use and is more labour-efficient and cost-efficient than conventional plating methods.Significance and Impact of the Study: The method can be used for rapid assessment of viable counts of micro-organisms similar to conventional plating using standard laboratory equipment. It is faster and cheaper than conventional plating methods.

Abstract
Colocalization of fluorescent signals in confocal microscopy is usually evaluated by inspecting merged images from different colour channels or by using commercially available software packages. We describe in this paper a simple method for assessment of nuclear localization of proteins in tissue sections through confocal immunolocalization, propidium iodide counterstaining and image analysis. Through a macro command developed for the public domain, Java-based software imagej, red, green, blue (RGB) images are automatically split in the red and green channels and a new image composed of the nonblack pixels coincident in both channels is created and inverted for better visualization. This method renders images devoid of both, extranuclear staining and background, thus emphasizing the nuclear signal. The resulting images can easily be used for comparison or quantification of the results. Given the simplicity of the technique and the worldwide diffusion of the software utilized, we think that this method could be useful in order to define standards of colocalization in confocal microscopy.

Abstract
Development, cancer, neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases, injury, and stem cell manipulations are characterised by alterations in cell number. Research into development, disease, and the effects of drugs require cell number counts. These are generally indirect estimates, because counting cells in an animal or organ is paradoxically difficult, as well as being tedious and unmanageable. Drosophila is a powerful model organism used to investigate the genetic bases of development and disease. There are Drosophila models for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, characterised by an increase in cell death. However, a fast, reliable, and accurate way to count the number of dying cells in vivo is not available. Here, we present a method based on image filtering and mathematical morphology techniques, to count automatically the number of dying cells in intact fruit-fly embryos. We call the resulting programme DeadEasy Caspase. It has been validated for Drosophila and we present examples of its power to address biological questions. Quantification is automatic, accurate, objective, and very fast. DeadEasy Caspase will be freely available as an ImageJ plug-in, and it can be modified for use in other sample types. It is of interest to the Drosophila and wider biomedical communities. DeadEasy Caspase is a powerful tool for the analysis of cell survival and cell death in development and in disease, such as neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. Combined with the power of Drosophila genetics, DeadEasy expands the tools that enable the use of Drosophila to analyse gene function, model disease and test drugs in the intact nervous system and whole animal.

Abstract
In long-term time-lapse studies of cell migration, it is often important to distinguish active movement of individual cells from global tissue motion caused, for instance, by morphogenetic changes, or due to artefacts. We have developed a method to define and correct global movements. This is realized by the sequential morphing of image sequences to the initial image based on the position of immobile reference objects. Technically, the approach is implemented in ImageJ, using the plugin UnwarpJ. We describe an efficient way to select parameter settings such as to optimize image correction. To this end, we implemented a strict statistical control that allows to quantify image registration quality. We document this approach using a time-lapse sequence of migrating interneurons in slice cultures of the developing cerebellum.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: A small remnant liver volume is an important risk factor for posthepatectomy liver failure and can be predicted accurately by computed tomography (CT) volumetry using radiologic image analysis software. Unfortunately, this software is expensive and usually requires support by a radiologist. ImageJ is a freely downloadable image analysis software package developed by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and brings liver volumetry to the surgeon's desktop. We aimed to assess the accuracy of ImageJ for hepatic CT volumetry. METHODS: ImageJ was downloaded from http://www.rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ . Preoperative CT scans of 15 patients who underwent liver resection for colorectal cancer liver metastases were retrospectively analyzed. Scans were opened in ImageJ; and the liver, all metastases, and the intended parenchymal transection line were manually outlined on each slice. The area of each selected region, metastasis, resection specimen, and remnant liver was multiplied by the slice thickness to calculate volume. Volumes of virtual liver resection specimens measured with ImageJ were compared with specimen weights and calculated volumes obtained during pathology examination after resection. RESULTS: There was an excellent correlation between the volumes calculated with ImageJ and the actual measured weights of the resection specimens (r(2) = 0.98, p < 0.0001). The weight/volume ratio amounted to 0.88 +/- 0.04 (standard error) and was in agreement with our earlier findings using CT-linked radiologic software. CONCLUSION: ImageJ can be used for accurate hepatic CT volumetry on a personal computer. This application brings CT volumetry to the surgeon's desktop at no expense and is particularly useful in cases of tertiary referred patients, who already have a proper CT scan on CD-ROM from the referring institution. Most likely the discrepancy between volume and weight results from exsanguination of the liver after resection.

Abstract
For several years we have included discussions about insect vision in the optics units of our introductory physics courses. This topic is a natural extension of demonstrations involving Brewster's reflection and Rayleigh scattering of polarized light because many insects heavily rely on optical polarization for navigation and communication. Students, especially those majoring in the life sciences, tend to find the conversation intriguing because of its interdisciplinary context. To make it even more appealing, we recently created a laboratory component that allows students to use digital cameras and polarizing filters to create polarization maps of environmental scenes and insect bodies. In this paper we describe how to do so with ImageJ, a widely used and freely available image processing program that is suitable for students with no programming experience.

Abstract
BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Transmission electron tomography is becoming a powerful tool for studying subcellular components of cells. Classical approaches for electron tomography consist of recording images along a single-tilt axis. This approach is being improved by dual-axis reconstructions and/or high-tilt devices (tilt angle>+/-60 degrees) on microscopes to compensate part of the information loss due to the 'missing wedge' phenomena. RESULTS: In the present work we have evaluated the extension of the dual-axis technique to a multiple-axis approach, and we demonstrate a freely available plug-in for the Java-based freeware image-analysis software ImageJ. Our results from phantom and experimental data sets from Paramecium tetraurelia epon-embedded sections have shown that multiple-axis tomography achieves results equivalent to those obtained by dual-axis approach without the requirement for high-tilt devices. CONCLUSIONS: This new approach allows performance of high-resolution tomography, avoiding the need for high-tilt devices, and therefore will increase the access of electron tomography to a larger community.

Abstract
Although computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) outperforms manual techniques, many investigators rely on non-automated analysis due to the high cost of commercial options. In this study, we have written and validated a free CASA software primarily for analysis of fish sperm. This software is a plugin for the free National Institutes of Health software ImageJ and is available with documentation at . That it is open source makes possible external validation, should improve quality control and enhance the comparative value of data obtained among laboratories. In addition, we have improved upon the traditional velocity straight line (VSL) algorithm, eliminating inaccurate characterization of highly curved fish sperm paths. Using this system, the motion of zebrafish (Danio rerio) sperm was characterized relative to time post-activation and the impact of acquisition conditions upon data analysis determined. There were decreases in velocity and path straightness (STR), but not linearity (LIN), relative to time. From 30 to 300 frames/s, frame rate significantly affected curvilinear velocity (VCL) and STR measurements. Sperm density in the field of view did not affect any measured parameter. There was significant inter-male variation for VCL, VSL, velocity average path (VAP), percent motility, path character (STR, LIN), and duration of motility. Furthermore, relative sperm output (a measure reflecting both semen volume and concentration) was positively correlated to percent motility. For all motion parameters measured (except duration), the average CV was < or =10%, comparable to values obtained using commercial systems.

Abstract
A wide variety of bioluminescent luciferase proteins are available for use in transcriptional or biochemical reporter assays. However, spectral overlap normally prevents them from being monitored simultaneously. To address this problem, a Java plug-in for ImageJ was written to deconvolute bioluminescent images composed of signals from multiple luciferases. The methodology was validated by testing the program with both simulated and real luciferase images. Bioluminescent images were acquired using a CCD camera equipped with optical filters, and the images were deconvoluted using the ImageJ plug-in. HeLa cells were transfected with either click beetle red luciferase (CBR), click beetle green luciferase (CBG99), or Renilla luciferase (Rluc), and mixed lysates were imaged in varying proportions in a 96-well plate to biochemically validate the methodology. After spectral deconvolution, the predicted, pure luciferase signals could be recovered with maximal cross-talk errors of +/-1.5%. In addition, live cells expressing CBR, CBG99, and Rluc were simultaneously imaged and deconvoluted in 96-well plates to demonstrate the feasibility of applying this methodology to high-throughput applications. Finally, multicolor transcriptional and posttranslational modification reporters were simultaneously imaged and shown to deconvolute normalized IkappaBeta kinase activity in longitudinal assays. Thus, our software provided a rapid, simple, and accurate method for simultaneously measuring multiple bioluminescent reporters in living cells.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: Traditional in vitro cell invasion assays focus on measuring one cell parameter at a time and are often less than ideal in terms of reproducibility and quantification. Further, many techniques are not suitable for quantifying the advancing margin of collectively migrating cells, arguably the most important area of activity during tumor invasion. We have developed and applied a highly quantitative, standardized, reproducible Nest Expansion Assay (NEA) to measure cancer cell invasion in vitro, which builds upon established wound-healing techniques. This assay involves creating uniform circular "nests" of cells within a monolayer of cells using a stabilized, silicone-tipped drill press, and quantifying the margin expansion into an overlaid extracellular matrix (ECM)-like component using computer-assisted applications. FINDINGS: The NEA was applied to two human-derived breast cell lines, MCF10A and MCF10A-CA1d, which exhibit opposite degrees of tumorigenicity and invasion in vivo. Assays were performed to incorporate various microenvironmental conditions, in order to test their influence on cell behavior and measures. Two types of computer-driven image analysis were performed using Java's freely available ImageJ software and its FracLac plugin to capture nest expansion and fractal dimension, respectively - which are both taken as indicators of invasiveness. Both analyses confirmed that the NEA is highly reproducible, and that the ECM component is key in defining invasive cell behavior. Interestingly, both analyses also detected significant differences between non-invasive and invasive cell lines, across various microenvironments, and over time. CONCLUSION: The spatial nature of the NEA makes its outcome susceptible to the global influence of many cellular parameters at once (e.g., motility, protease secretion, cell-cell adhesion). We propose the NEA as a mid-throughput technique for screening and simultaneous examination of factors contributing to cancer cell invasion, particularly suitable for parameterizing and validating Cancer Systems Biology approaches such as mathematical modeling.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To compare reliability and limits of agreement of soft tissue cross-sectional areas obtained using Slice-O-Matic and NIH ImageJ medical imaging software packages. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Abdominal and midthigh images were obtained using single-slice computed tomography. Two trained investigators analyzed each computed tomography image in duplicate. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle cross-sectional areas (centimeters squared) were calculated using standard Hounsfield unit ranges (adipose tissue: -190 to -30 and skeletal muscle: -29 to 150). Regions of interest included abdominal total area, total fat area, subcutaneous fat area, visceral fat area (AVF), and right and left thigh total area, fat area, and skeletal muscle area. RESULTS: For all images, intra-investigator coefficients of variation ranged from 0.2% to 3.4% and from 0.4% to 5.6% and inter-investigator coefficients of variation ranged from 0.9% to 4.8% and 0.2% to 2.6% for Slice-O-Matic and NIH ImageJ, respectively, with intra- and inter-investigator coefficients of reliability of R(2) = 0.99. Mean AVF values for investigators A and B ranged from 168 to 170 cm(2) using Slice-O-Matic and NIH ImageJ. Bland-Altman analyses revealed that Slice-O-Matic and NIH ImageJ results were comparable. The mean differences (95% confidence intervals) between the AVF cross-sectional areas obtained using the Slice-O-Matic and NIH ImageJ medical imaging software were +2.5 cm(2) (-5.7, +10.8 cm(2)) or +1.4% (-3.4%, +6.4%). DISCUSSION: These findings show that both the Slice-O-Matic and NIH ImageJ medical imaging software systems provide reliable measurements of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle cross-sectional areas.

Abstract
In vitro assays to measure neuronal growth are a fundamental tool used by many neurobiologists studying neuronal development and regeneration. The quantification of these assays requires accurate measurements of neurite length and neuronal cell numbers in neuronal cultures. Generally, these measurements are obtained through labor-intensive manual or semi-manual tracing of images. To automate these measurements, we have written NeuriteTracer, a neurite tracing plugin for the freely available image-processing program ImageJ. The plugin analyzes fluorescence microscopy images of neurites and nuclei of dissociated cultured neurons. Given user-defined thresholds, the plugin counts neuronal nuclei, and traces and measures neurite length. We find that NeuriteTracer accurately measures neurite outgrowth from cerebellar, DRG and hippocampal neurons. Values obtained by NeuriteTracer correlate strongly with those obtained by semi-manual tracing with NeuronJ and by using a sophisticated analysis package, MetaXpress. We reveal the utility of NeuriteTracer by demonstrating its ability to detect the neurite outgrowth promoting capacity of the rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Our plugin is an attractive alternative to existing tracing tools because it is fully automated and ready for use within a freely accessible imaging program.

Abstract
This study was carried out to describe a simple, accurate, and practical technique for assessing mandible cysts' area on routine orthopantomograms using digital planimetry.Forty orthopantomograms showing mandibular cysts were obtained. The digitalized images were used to measure the surface area of the half mandibles and cysts using ImageJ software by an observer. The projection area of the half mandibles and cysts was provided by the machine. The surface area fraction of the cysts within the half mandibles was estimated by using the projection area fraction (PAF) approach. Estimations were repeated on films 1 month later.The mean PAF (mean +/- SEM) obtained by the same observer in 2 sessions was 10.6% +/- 2.3% and 13.0% +/- 2.0% for the right and left sides, respectively. The estimation results of 2 sessions were compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. This study found no statistical difference between the estimated PAF values (P > 0.05). The estimation results of the same observer at 1-month intervals were analyzed statistically to check intraobserver variation using a correlation analysis test, which found a high degree of agreement for the results estimated using the planimetric method for the right and left sides (r = 0.994, P < 0.001 and r = 0.999, P < 0.001, respectively).The method described in this study is inexpensive and fast because planimetry can be performed within a couple of minutes per subject. This method can also be used to monitor the size difference of lesions evaluated for clinical follow-up and research.

Abstract
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although many methods exist for quantifying the number of pollen grains in a sample, there are few standard methods that are user-friendly, inexpensive and reliable. The present contribution describes a new method of counting pollen using readily available, free image processing and analysis software. METHODS: Pollen was collected from anthers of two species, Carduus acanthoides and C. nutans (Asteraceae), then illuminated on slides and digitally photographed through a stereomicroscope. Using ImageJ (NIH), these digital images were processed to remove noise and sharpen individual pollen grains, then analysed to obtain a reliable total count of the number of grains present in the image. A macro was developed to analyse multiple images together. To assess the accuracy and consistency of pollen counting by ImageJ analysis, counts were compared with those made by the human eye. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Image analysis produced pollen counts in 60 s or less per image, considerably faster than counting with the human eye (5-68 min). In addition, counts produced with the ImageJ procedure were similar to those obtained by eye. Because count parameters are adjustable, this image analysis protocol may be used for many other plant species. Thus, the method provides a quick, inexpensive and reliable solution to counting pollen from digital images, not only reducing the chance of error but also substantially lowering labour requirements.

Abstract
Traditionally, the amount of infective chlamydiae in a given sample is determined by inoculating dilution series into cell cultures and physically counting chlamydial inclusions. This approach is time consuming, tedious, and error prone, mainly when dealing with high titers. Therefore, this paper describes a largely automated technique that was developed to standardize the determination of chlamydial load in vitro. Cells are fixed at 36 h post-inoculation and bacteria visualized using standard immunological detection methods. Consequently, for 81 microscopic fields, an image is recorded at the interpolated focal plane. These images are then automatically processed using an ImageJ plugin and the obtained results are imported into Excel to determine the number of inclusion forming units per mL in the sample. The main advantage of this technique is that no or minimal sample dilution is required, thus minimizing dilution errors. In addition, this technique was employed during the early, middle and late growth stages of the chlamydial developmental cycle and results correlated well (P < 0.01) with 16S rRNA values from previous experiments, thereby proving its suitability to follow chlamydial growth in vitro. The method described is highly suitable for high throughput titration of cell culture inoculated samples and assessment of possible antichlamydial effects of novel compounds throughout the chlamydial growth cycle.

Abstract
The technique of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has evolved in the last 15 years from a research concept into a clinically relevant medical procedure. In this study, an efficient, semi-automated and cost-effective solution for the analysis of fMRI images acquired in a clinical setting is presented relying heavily on open source software. The core of the pipeline is the software Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)) combined with K-PACS and ImageJ. Its application is illustrated with clinical fMRI exams and with a research study involving comparing subjects diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and age-matched controls.

Abstract
We present a semiautomated software solution to the problem of extending the lateral field of view of a classical microscope. The initial requirements are a set of overlapping images, along with their user-provided coarse mosaic. Our solution then refines this initial mosaic in a fully automatic fashion. We rely on a highly accurate registration engine to perform the pairwise registration of the individual images, and on an efficient strategy to minimize the amount of computations while maintaining the highest possible global quality. We describe these ingredients, which we make available as a free multiplatform user-friendly software package. We also highlight why and how the specific aspects of the present microscopy application differ from those encountered while creating more common mosaics such as panoramas. Finally, we present experimental results that illustrate and validate our method on a real biological sample. We conclude by showing that we are able to reach subpixel accuracy.

Abstract
Virtually all reliable TEM tomographic reconstructions in life science depend upon cross-correlating successive images in a tilt-stack, and then using gold nanobeads as fiducial markers for determining the relative image rotation axis. Although the rotational tilt angle is one of the essential parameters affecting the quality of tomographic reconstructions, little is discussed about its determination. We provide here a simple tool based on the property of Fast Fourier Transformation for determining this rotation axis offset angle. Our method uses two publicly-available software packages (IMOD and ImageJ), and can be used on any TEM-based image stack, which is useful for images with poor bead distribution or situations where such beads are not visible. We illustrate this procedure with two different biological samples, one of which is a plunge frozen cryo-sample with fiducials and the other an epon-embedded thin section without fiducials. Prior knowledge of the rotational tilt angle facilitates further processing tomograms. With cross-correlation and the FFT-obtained rotational tilt angle, we reconstructed tomograms, of which the cross-section did not show "arc" distortion. This tool could be easily incorporated into any software for the alignment with or without fiducials.

Abstract
We investigated bone structural adaptations to a 16-month school-based physical activity intervention in 202 young boys using a novel analytical method for peripheral quantitative computed tomography scans of the tibial mid-shaft. Our intervention effectively increased bone bending strength in the anterior-posterior plane as estimated with the maximum second moment of area (I(max)). INTRODUCTION: We previously reported positive effects of a physical activity intervention on peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT)-derived bone strength at the tibial mid-shaft in young boys. The present study further explored structural adaptations to the intervention using a novel method for pQCT analysis. METHODS: Participants were 202 boys (aged 9-11 years) from 10 schools randomly assigned to control (CON, 63 boys) and intervention (INT, 139 boys) groups. INT boys participated in 60 min/week of classroom physical activity, including a bone-loading program. We used ImageJ to process pQCT images of the tibial mid-shaft and determine the second moments of area (I(max), I(min)) and cortical area (CoA) and thickness (CTh) by quadrant (anterior, medial, lateral, posterior). We defined quadrants according to pixel coordinates about the centroid. We used mixed linear models to compare change in bone outcomes between groups. RESULTS: The INT boys had a 3% greater gain in I(max) than the CON boys (p = 0.04) and tended to have a greater gain in I(min) ( approximately 2%, NS). Associated with the greater gain in I(max) was a slightly greater (NS) gain (1-1.4%) in CoA and CTh in the anterior, medial, and posterior (but not lateral) quadrants. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest regional variation in bone adaptation consistent with patterns of bone formation induced by anterior-posterior bending loads.

Abstract
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) allows the user to investigate interactions between fluorescent partners. One crucial issue when calculating sensitized emission FRET is the correction for spectral bleed-throughs (SBTs), which requires to calculate the ratios between the intensities in the FRET and in the donor or acceptor settings, when only the donor or acceptor are present. Theoretically, SBT ratios should be constant. However, experimentally, these ratios can vary as a function of fluorophore intensity, and assuming constant values may hinder precise FRET calculation. One possible cause for such a variation is the use of a microscope set-up with different photomultipliers for the donor and FRET channels, a set-up allowing higher speed acquisitions on very dynamic fluorescent molecules in living cells. Herein, we show that the bias introduced by the differential response of the two PMTs can be circumvented by a simple modeling of the SBT ratios as a function of fluorophore intensity. Another important issue when performing FRET is the localization of FRET within the cell or a population of cells. We hence developed a freely available ImageJ plug-in, called PixFRET, that allows a simple and rapid determination of SBT parameters and the display of normalized FRET images. The usefulness of this modeling and of the plug-in are exemplified by the study of FRET in a system where two interacting nuclear receptors labeled with ECFP and EYFP are coexpressed in living cells.

Abstract
SUMMARY: Three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D-FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning of chromosomes or specific sequences such as genes or RNA in cell nuclei. Many different programs (commercial or free) allow image analysis for 3D-FISH experiments. One of the more efficient open-source programs for automatically processing 3D-FISH microscopy images is Smart 3D-FISH, an ImageJ plug-in designed to automatically analyze distances between genes. One of the drawbacks of Smart 3D-FISH is that it has a rather basic user interface and produces its results in various text and image files thus making the data post-processing step time-consuming. We developed a new Smart 3D-FISH graphical user interface, NEMO, which provides all information in the same place so that results can be checked and validated efficiently. NEMO give users the ability to drive their experiments analysis in either automatic, semi-automatic or manual detection mode. We also tuned Smart 3D-FISH to better analyze chromosome territories. AVAILABILITY: NEMO is a standalone Java application available for Windows and Linux platforms. The program is distributed under the creative commons licence and can be freely downloaded from https://www-lgc.toulouse.inra.fr/internet/index.php/Tools/Nemo.html CONTACT: eddie.iannuccelli@toulouse.inra.fr.

Abstract
Tracing changes of specific cell populations in health and disease is an important goal of biomedical research. Precisely monitoring pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and islet growth is a challenging area of research. We have developed a method to capture the distribution of beta-cells in the intact pancreas of transgenic mice with fluorescence-tagged beta-cells with a macro written for ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Total beta-cell area and islet number and size distribution are quantified with reference to specific parameters and location for each islet and for small clusters of beta-cells. The entire distribution of islets can now be plotted in three dimensions, and the information from the distribution on the size and shape of each islet allows a quantitative and a qualitative comparison of changes in overall beta-cell area at a glance.

Abstract
Quick and accurate particle size distribution analysis is desirable in various technical fields that handle granular or particulate materials including size reduction. We developed an ImageJ plugin that extracts the dimensions from a digital image of disjoint particles after identifying their shapes and determines their particles size distribution. We established that the major and minor axes of ImageJ fitted ellipse along with the developed correction factors efficiently determined dimensions of particles. This paper describes the plugin development and its application to food grains and ground biomass. Using computer generated geometrical shapes as reference objects, a shape identification strategy that addresses common geometric shapes such as square, inclined square, rectangle, inclined rectangle, circle, ellipse, and inclined ellipse was developed. The strategy used only three newly defined shape parameters to identify objects, such as reciprocal aspect ratio, rectangularity, and feret major axis ratio from the standard outputs generated by ImageJ. Evaluation of effects of the particles shape, size, and orientation on the deviation from the reference particle's length and width indicated that the mean absolute deviations of all these factors were less than 1.3%. Developed plugin was applied successfully to analyze the dimensions and size distribution of food grains and ground Miscanthus particles images. The plugin produced quick and accurate size distribution of particles from digital images and can be applied to variety of particle analysis applications.. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: The acceptor photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method is widely used for monitoring molecular interactions in cells. This method of FRET, while among those with the simplest mathematics, is robust, self-controlled and independent of fluorophore amounts and ratios. RESULTS: AccPbFRET is a user-friendly, efficient ImageJ plugin which allows fully corrected, pixel-wise calculation and detailed, ROI (region of interest)-based analysis of FRET efficiencies in microscopic images. Furthermore, automatic registration and semi-automatic analysis of large image sets is provided, which are not available in any existing FRET evaluation software. CONCLUSION: Despite of the widespread applicability of the acceptor photobleaching FRET technique, this is the first paper where all possible sources of major errors of the measurement and analysis are considered, and AccPbFRET is the only program which provides the complete suite of corrections--for registering image pairs, for unwanted photobleaching of the donor, for cross-talk of the acceptor and/or its photoproduct to the donor channel and for partial photobleaching of the acceptor. The program efficiently speeds up the analysis of large image sets even for novice users and is freely available.

Abstract
The use of new materials in knee arthroplasty demands a way in which to accurately quantify wear in retrieved components. Methods such as damage scoring, coordinate measurement, and in vivo wear analysis have been used in the past. The limitations in these methods illustrate a need for a different methodology that can accurately quantify wear, which is relatively easy to perform and uses a minimal amount of expensive equipment. Off-the-shelf digital photogrammetry represents a potentially quick and easy alternative to what is readily available. Eighty tibial inserts were visually examined for front and backside wear and digitally photographed in the presence of two calibrated reference fields. All images were segmented (via manual and automated algorithms) using Adobe Photoshop and National Institute of Health ImageJ. Finally, wear was determined using ImageJ and Rhinoceros software. The absolute accuracy of the method and repeatability/reproducibility by different observers were measured in order to determine the uncertainty of wear measurements. To determine if variation in wear measurements was due to implant design, 35 implants of the three most prevalent designs were subjected to retrieval analysis. The overall accuracy of area measurements was 97.8%. The error in automated segmentation was found to be significantly lower than that of manual segmentation. The photogrammetry method was found to be reasonably accurate and repeatable in measuring 2-D areas and applicable to determining wear. There was no significant variation in uncertainty detected among different implant designs. Photogrammetry has a broad range of applicability since it is size- and design-independent. A minimal amount of off-the-shelf equipment is needed for the procedure and no proprietary knowledge of the implant is needed.

Abstract
PURPOSE: To develop and validate a method to quantify posterior capsule opacification (PCO) in eyes after cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation using Scheimpflug Pentacam tomograms and compare its validity with slit lamp retroillumination image analysis. METHODS: One hundred twenty-four pseudophakic eyes of 124 patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 40 eyes with visually significant PCO, and group 2 consisted of 84 eyes without visually significant PCO. Pentacam Imaging was performed after full mydriasis using the 50-scan acquisition protocol, and high-resolution tomograms were reconstructed and analyzed using ImageJ freeware. Retroillumination photographs were captured for group 1 eyes using the Topcon digital slit lamp, and these were analyzed using POCOman software to calculate an aggregate severity grade and percentage PCO value. Correlation coefficients were calculated for PCO values obtained using POCOman and ImageJ. RESULTS: Mean PCO percentage value obtained using POCOman software was 23.34 +/- 6.25 U, mean aggregate PCO severity grade was 0.46 +/- 0.28 U, and mean pixel-intensity value using ImageJ was 31.071 +/- 8.26 U. There was a significant positive correlation between the percentage PCO (P = 0.000; r = 0.864) and PCO severity grade (P = 0.001; r = 0.490) obtained for group 1 eyes using slit lamp retroillumination images and PCO pixel intensity obtained using Pentacam tomograms. CONCLUSIONS: Retroillumination photographs are the standard for quantifying PCO. Pentacam tomograms are easier to obtain and are free of flash reflections, and they allow for a more objective analysis. The correlation between the two methods demonstrates that ImageJ analysis of Pentacam tomograms is a viable tool for PCO analysis.

Abstract
Measures of parasitemia by intraerythrocytic hematozoan parasites are normally expressed as the number of infected erythrocytes per n erythrocytes and are notoriously tedious and time consuming to measure. We describe a protocol for generating rapid counts of nucleated erythrocytes from digital micrographs of thin blood smears that can be used to estimate intensity of hematozoan infections in nonmammalian vertebrate hosts. This method takes advantage of the bold contrast and relatively uniform size and morphology of erythrocyte nuclei on Giemsa-stained blood smears and uses ImageJ, a java-based image analysis program developed at the U.S. National Institutes of Health and available on the internet, to recognize and count these nuclei. This technique makes feasible rapid and accurate counts of total erythrocytes in large numbers of microscope fields, which can be used in the calculation of peripheral parasitemias in low-intensity infections.

Abstract
Capture and quantitative analysis of the motion of organisms is a powerful tool that can be used in diverse biological. fields including physiology, behavior, kinematics, and ecology. A number of high-end commercial motion capture and analysis systems that offer a wide array of features and image capture and analysis capabilities are available. However, few, if any, such systems are low cost and could be used for projects with small budgets or by researchers interested in collecting pilot data before upgrading to an expensive motion capture and analysis system. Our paper describes a low-cost (<{\$}US1000, not including the cost of the computer) motion capture and analysis system that simultaneously captures live video from 5 digital video cameras (Unibrain Fire-i FireWire [IEEE 1394]) using standard security camera software (SecuritySpy 1.3.1). The video analyses are carried out using a combination of standard spreadsheet software (Microsoft Excel) and a freeware image-analysis program (NIH Image J), with one of the available particle-tracking plugins. Tests using New Zealand mudsnails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) demonstrated that the system could record and accurately track the movement of small (4 mm) targets. Recommendations for designing similar project-specific systems are provided.

Abstract
A standard method for quantifying the geometric properties of vocal folds has not been widely adopted. An ideal method of geometrical measurement should effectively quantify the dimensions of the medial vibratory portion of the vocal fold, should be easily performed, should yield consistent results, and should be readily available at little to no cost. We have developed a new approach for geometrical measurements to meet these goals. The objective of this study is to describe this new approach and to assess its effectiveness in a canine model of vocal fold scar. One hundred thirty-five mid-membranous coronal sections of vocal folds from 10 canines (five with unilateral surgical scarring) were examined by light microscopy; digital images were captured. ImageJ was used to measure a variety of described parameters. Comparison between scarred vocal folds and control vocal folds was made. At least 20% of the slides for each vocal fold were randomly selected (n=42) for repeat measurements of interrater and intrarater reliability. A statistically significant difference between scarred and control vocal folds was obtained for horizontal distance (P<0.001), vertical distance (P=0.005), area (P<0.001), mean optical density (OD) (P<0.001), and OD at defined points along the length of the vocal fold (P< or =0.009). Reliability calculations for intrarater and interrater measurements ranged from r=0.845 to r=0.994 and from r=0.734 to r=0.976, respectively. The proposed approach for geometrical measurements meets the intended objectives in a canine model of vocal fold scar. Future work is needed to apply this approach to other model systems.

Abstract
The intensity-based ratiometric FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) method is a powerful technique for following molecular interactions in living cells. Since it is not based on irreversibly destroying the donor or the acceptor fluorophores, the time course of changes in FRET efficiency values can be monitored by this method. ImageJ, a sophisticated software tool for many types of image processing allows users to extend it with programs for various purposes. Implementing intensity-based ratiometric FRET with ImageJ vastly enhances the applicability of the FRET method. We developed an efficient ImageJ plugin, RiFRET, which calculates FRET efficiency on a pixel-by-pixel basis from ratiometric FRET images. It allows the user to correct for channel cross-talk (bleed-through) and to calculate FRET from image stacks, i.e., from 3D data sets. Semiautomatic processing for larger datasets is also included in the program. Furthermore, several options for calibrating FRET efficiency calculations were tested and their applicability to various expression systems is discussed. Although the ratiometric FRET method is widely applied, our plugin is the first freely available software for evaluating such FRET data. The program is user friendly and provides reliable, standardized results.

Abstract
ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Cell size is a structural component of fleshy fruit, contributing to important traits such as fruit size and texture. There are currently a number of methods for measuring cell size; most rely either on tissue sectioning or digestion of the tissue with cell wall degrading enzymes or chemicals to release single cells. Neither of these approaches is ideal for assaying large fruit numbers as both require a considerable time to prepare the tissue, with current methods of cell wall digestions taking 24 to 48 hours. Additionally, sectioning can lead to a measurement of a plane that does not represent the widest point of the cell. RESULTS: To develop a more rapid way of measuring fruit cell size we have developed a protocol that solubilises pectin in the middle lamella of the plant cell wall releasing single cells into a buffered solution. Gently boiling small fruit samples in a 0.05 M Na2CO3 solution, osmotically balanced with 0.3 M mannitol, produced good cell separation with little cellular damage in less than 30 minutes. The advantage of combining a chemical treatment with boiling is that the cells are rapidly killed. This stopped cell shape changes that could potentially occur during separation. With this method both the rounded and angular cells of the apple cultivars SciRos 'Pacific Rose' and SciFresh 'Jazz' were observed in the separated cells. Using this technique, an in-depth analysis was performed measuring cell size from 5 different apple cultivars. Cell size was measured using the public domain ImageJ software. For each cultivar a minimum of 1000 cells were measured and it was found that each cultivar displayed a different distribution of cell size. Cell size within cultivars was similar and there was no correlation between flesh firmness and cell size. This protocol was tested on tissue from other fleshy fruit including tomato, rock melon and kiwifruit. It was found that good cell separation was achieved with flesh tissue from all these fruit types, showing a broad utility to this protocol. CONCLUSION: We have developed a method for isolating single cells from fleshy fruit that reduces the time needed for fruit cell separation. This method was used to demonstrate differences in cell size and shape for 5 different apple cultivars. While firmness between the different cultivars is independent of cell size, apples with more angular cells appear to be firmer.

Abstract
Quantitative measurement of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation is an important research tool in cellular immunology. Established methodologies have a number of limitations, such as poor sensitivity, high cost or dependence on cell lines. Novel imaging methods to measure nuclear translocation of transcriptionally active components of NF-kappaB are being used but are also partly limited by the need for specialist imaging equipment or image analysis software. Herein we present a method for quantitative detection of NF-kappaB rel A nuclear translocation, using immunofluorescence microscopy and the public domain image analysis software ImageJ that can be easily adopted for cellular immunology research without the need for specialist image analysis expertise and at low cost. The method presented here is validated by demonstrating the time course and dose response of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in primary human macrophages stimulated with LPS, and by comparison with a commercial NF-kappaB activation reporter cell line.

Abstract
We present a new, robust, computational procedure for tracking fluorescent markers in time-lapse microscopy. The algorithm is optimized for finding the time-trajectory of single particles in very noisy dynamic (two- or three-dimensional) image sequences. It proceeds in three steps. First, the images are aligned to compensate for the movement of the biological structure under investigation. Second, the particle's signature is enhanced by applying a Mexican hat filter, which we show to be the optimal detector of a Gaussian-like spot in 1/omega2 noise. Finally, the optimal trajectory of the particle is extracted by applying a dynamic programming optimization procedure. We have used this software, which is implemented as a Java plug-in for the public-domain ImageJ software, to track the movement of chromosomal loci within nuclei of budding yeast cells. Besides reducing trajectory analysis time by several 100-fold, we achieve high reproducibility and accuracy of tracking. The application of the method to yeast chromatin dynamics reveals different classes of constraints on mobility of telomeres, reflecting differences in nuclear envelope association. The generic nature of the software allows application to a variety of similar biological imaging tasks that require the extraction and quantitation of a moving particle's trajectory.

Abstract
Studies of neuronal differentiation in vitro often involve tracing and analysis of neurites. Neuron) (Meijering et al., Cytometry Part A 2004;58A:167-176; http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/neuronj/) is a program that can be used for semi-automated tracing of individual neurons; when tracing is completed, a text file containing neurite length measurements is generated. Using cultured hippocampal neurons, we have found that to reach statistical significance it is generally necessary to trace about 100 neurons in each treatment group. Posttracing data analysis requires importing each text file into a statistics program. Analysis of distinct parameters, such as effects of a treatment on axonal versus dendritic branching, requires a great deal of time consuming posttracing data manipulation. We have developed XL_Calculations, a Java-based program that performs batch analysis on Neuron) measurement files and automatically makes multiple calculations, including the number, length, and total output (sum length) of primary, secondary, and tertiary neurites on axons and dendrites, and writes the calculations into an Excel worksheet. Batch processing of Neuron) measurement files dramatically reduces the time required to analyze neuronal morphology. In addition, our program performs more than 45 distinct calculations, enabling detailed determination of treatment effects on neuronal differentiation. Using this program to analyze Neuron) tracing data, we demonstrate that continuous exposure of differentiating hippocampal neurons to Netrin 1 increases the number of secondary branches on both axons and dendrites, without significantly altering the length of the axon, dendrites, or branches. Similar results were obtained when neurons were grown on poly-D-lysine or laminin. (C) 2008 International Society far Advancement of Cytometry

Abstract
AIM: The aim of this methodological study was to validate a new method for root coverage evaluation following periodontal plastic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty recessions were treated in 21 consecutive patients, using a subepithelial connective tissue graft technique. Clinical measurements and photographs were taken at baseline and 12+/-6 months after treatment. The mean percentage of root coverage for linear and surface area measurements was calculated using conventional clinical evaluation, and compared with ImageJ, a public domain Java image processing program. Bland-Altman plots were used for assessing repeatability and agreement between clinical and ImageJ measurements. The strength of the relationship was calculated using the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The repeatability of ImageJ was excellent for both linear and surface area measurements. The agreement between clinical and ImageJ measurements was good for the linear evaluation, showing lower and upper limits of -13.14% and 17.42%, respectively. Significant correlations (p<0.001) were found between clinical and ImageJ measurements, ranging from 0.93 to 0.94 for linear evaluation, and from 0.89 to 0.90 for surface evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this study show that the ImageJ analysis is a reliable, reproducible method to evaluate the percentage of root coverage after periodontal plastic surgery, when a midfacial linear measurement is used.

Abstract
Quantitative analysis of mosaic tissues is a powerful method for following developmental lineages; however, analytical techniques are often subjective and repetitious. Here a flexible, semi-automated image analysis method for mosaic patterns is described. ClonalTools is a free customizable tool-set designed for the open-source image analysis package ImageJ. Circular, polygonal or linear one-dimensional mosaic arrays can be interrogated to provide measurements of the total number and width of positive and negative patches in a region of interest. These results are adjusted for the effects of random clumping using a previously described method to correct for differences in the contribution of the positive and negative cell type. The applicability of ClonalTools to different systems is discussed with reference to the analysis of mosaic patterns in the mouse corneal epithelium and adrenal cortex and in the outgrowth of neurites from explant cultures of mouse retina as example systems. To validate ClonalTools quantitatively, a recently published manual clonal analysis of the corneal epithelium of X-inactivation beta-Gal-mosaic mice was re-analysed. The semi-automated results did not differ significantly from the published data. Rapid quantification of such patterns to produce biologically relevant results represents a welcome improvement in terms of ease and speed of use over previous methods.

Abstract
Digital reconstruction of neuronal arborizations is an important step in the quantitative investigation of cellular neuroanatomy. In this process, neurites imaged by microscopy are semi-manually traced through the use of specialized computer software and represented as binary trees of branching cylinders (or truncated cones). Such form of the reconstruction files is efficient and parsimonious, and allows extensive morphometric analysis as well as the implementation of biophysical models of electrophysiology. Here, we describe Neuron_ Morpho, a plugin for the popular Java application ImageJ that mediates the digital reconstruction of neurons from image stacks. Both the executable and code of Neuron_ Morpho are freely distributed (www.maths. soton.ac.uk/staff/D'Alessandro/morpho or www.krasnow.gmu.edu/L-Neuron), and are compatible with all major computer platforms (including Windows, Mac, and Linux). We tested Neuron_Morpho by reconstructing two neurons from each of the two preparations representing different brain areas (hippocampus and cerebellum), neuritic type (pyramidal cell dendrites and olivar axonal projection terminals), and labeling method (rapid Golgi impregnation and anterograde dextran amine), and quantitatively comparing the resulting morphologies to those of the same cells reconstructed with the standard commercial system, Neurolucida. None of the numerous morphometric measures that were analyzed displayed any significant or systematic difference between the two reconstructing systems.

Abstract
Using primary cell culture to screen for changes in neuronal morphology requires specialized analysis software. We developed NeuronMetrics for semi-automated, quantitative analysis of two-dimensional (2D) images of fluorescently labeled cultured neurons. It skeletonizes the neuron image using two complementary image-processing techniques, capturing fine terminal neurites with high fidelity. An algorithm was devised to span wide gaps in the skeleton. NeuronMetrics uses a novel strategy based on geometric features called faces to extract a branch number estimate from complex arbors with numerous neurite-to-neurite contacts, without creating a precise, contact-free representation of the neurite arbor. It estimates total neurite length, branch number, primary neurite number, territory (the area of the convex polygon bounding the skeleton and cell body), and Polarity Index (a measure of neuronal polarity). These parameters provide fundamental information about the size and shape of neurite arbors, which are critical factors for neuronal function. NeuronMetrics streamlines optional manual tasks such as removing noise, isolating the largest primary neurite, and correcting length for self-fasciculating neurites. Numeric data are output in a single text file, readily imported into other applications for further analysis. Written as modules for ImageJ, NeuronMetrics provides practical analysis tools that are easy to use and support batch processing. Depending on the need for manual intervention, processing time for a batch of approximately 60 2D images is 1.0-2.5 h, from a folder of images to a table of numeric data. NeuronMetrics' output accelerates the quantitative detection of mutations and chemical compounds that alter neurite morphology in vitro, and will contribute to the use of cultured neurons for drug discovery.

Abstract
A rapid immunochromatographic assay was developed to detect 17-19-Nortestosterone (19-NT). The 19-NT-OVA conjugate was immobilised to nitrocellulose membrane as a test line and goat anti-rabbit IgG as a control line. Anti-19-NT polyclonal antibody labelled with colloidal gold particles acted as detector reagent. We tested the sensitivity of the strip using spiked swine urine, and analysed the intensity of test line using ImageJ software. The sensitivity by naked eye measurement was determined to be 200 ng/ml and lower limit using ImageJ was distinguished as 5 ng/ml. The total assay time was less than 20 min, suitable for screening and quantifying the residue of 19-NT in swine urine.

Abstract
Earth science classes in colleges and high schools use a variety of satellite image processing software to teach earth science and remote sensing principles. However, current tutorials for image processing software are often paper-based or lecture-based and do not take advantage of the full potential of the computer context to teach, immerse, and stimulate students. We present EarthTutor, an adaptive, interactive Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) being built for NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) that is integrated directly with an image processing application. The system aims to foster the use of satellite imagery in classrooms and encourage inquiry-based, hands-on earth science scientific study by providing students with an engaging imagery analysis learning environment. EarthTutor's software is available as a plug-in to ImageJ, a free image processing system developed by the NIH (National Institute of Health). Since it is written in Java, it can be run on almost any platform and also as an applet from the Web. Labs developed for EarthTutor combine lesson content (such as HTML web pages) with interactive activities and questions. In each lab the student learns to measure, calibrate, color, slice, plot and otherwise process and analyze earth science imagery. During the activities, EarthTutor monitors students closely as they work, which allows it to provide immediate feedback that is customized to a particular student's needs. As the student moves through the labs, EarthTutor assesses the student, and tailors the presentation of the content to a student's demonstrated skill level. EarthTutor's adaptive approach is based on emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Bayesian networks are employed to model a student's proficiency with different earth science and image processing concepts. Agent behaviors are used to track the student's progress through activities and provide guidance when a student encounters difficulty. Through individual feedback and adaptive instruction, EarthTutor aims to offer the benefits of a one-on-one human instructor in a cost-effective, easy-to-use application. We are currently working with remote sensing experts to develop EarthTutor labs for diverse earth science subjects such as global vegetation, stratospheric ozone, oceanography, polar sea ice and natural hazards. These labs will be packaged with the first public release of EarthTutor in December 2005. Custom labs can be designed with the EarthTutor authoring tool. The tool is basic enough to allow teachers to construct tutorials to fit their classroom's curriculum and locale, but also powerful enough to allow advanced users to create highly-interactive labs. Preliminary results from an ongoing pilot study demonstrate that the EarthTutor system is effective and enjoyable teaching tool, relative to traditional satellite imagery teaching methods.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: Image analysis of tissue sections using RGB image profiling is a modern accepted technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new method of RGB analysis, using the freeware ImageJ, is presented which can be applied to sections with either nuclear or cytoplasmic staining. The step-by-step process is presented and the method is tested using breast cancer specimens immunostained for CK-19 and estrogen receptors. RESULTS: This image analysis easily discriminates CK-19 and estrogen receptor positivity in prepared breast cancer specimens. The method is easy to perform, without the need for previous image transformations. CONCLUSION: Compared to previous methods, this method proved more accurate in estimating the actual colours that an observer recognizes as positive after immunostaining. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether this method is efficient enough to be applied in clinical practice.

Abstract
SUMMARY: High-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) imaging of large biological specimens generates massive image datasets that are difficult to navigate, annotate and share effectively. Inspired by online mapping applications like GoogleMaps, we developed a decentralized web interface that allows seamless navigation of arbitrarily large image stacks. Our interface provides means for online, collaborative annotation of the biological image data and seamless sharing of regions of interest by bookmarking. The CATMAID interface enables synchronized navigation through multiple registered datasets even at vastly different scales such as in comparisons between optical and electron microscopy.

Abstract
Ca sparks are elementary Ca-release events from intracellular Ca stores that are observed in virtually all types of muscle. Typically, Ca sparks are measured in the line-scan mode with confocal laser-scanning microscopes, yielding two-dimensional images (distance vs. time). The manual analysis of these images is time consuming and prone to errors as well as investigator bias. Therefore, we developed SparkMaster, an automated analysis program that allows rapid and reliable spark analysis. The underlying analysis algorithm is adapted from the threshold-based standard method of spark analysis developed by Cheng et al. (Biophys J 76: 606-617, 1999) and is implemented here in the freely available image-processing software ImageJ. SparkMaster offers a graphical user interface through which all analysis parameters and output options are selected. The analysis includes general image parameters (number of detected sparks, spark frequency) and individual spark parameters (amplitude, full width at half-maximum amplitude, full duration at half-maximum amplitude, full width, full duration, time to peak, maximum steepness of spark upstroke, time constant of spark decay). We validated the algorithm using images with synthetic sparks embedded into backgrounds with different signal-to-noise ratios to determine an analysis criteria at which a high sensitivity is combined with a low frequency of false-positive detections. Finally, we applied SparkMaster to analyze experimental data of sparks measured in intact and permeabilized ventricular cardiomyocytes, permeabilized mammalian skeletal muscle, and intact smooth muscle cells. We found that SparkMaster provides a reliable, easy to use, and fast way of analyzing Ca sparks in a wide variety of experimental conditions.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: The investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation, particularly in embryonic stem cells, has received increasing attention and involves the systematic identification of target genes and the analysis of promoter co-occupancy. High-throughput approaches based on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) have been widely used for this purpose. However, these approaches remain time-consuming, expensive, labor-intensive, involve multiple steps, and require complex statistical analysis. Advances in this field will greatly benefit from the development and use of simple, fast, sensitive and straightforward ChIP assay and analysis methodologies. RESULTS: We initially developed a simplified, basic ChIP protocol that combines simplicity, speed and sensitivity. ChIP analysis by real-time PCR was compared to analysis by densitometry with the ImageJ software. This protocol allowed the rapid identification of known target genes for SOX2, NANOG, OCT3/4, SOX17, KLF4, RUNX2, OLIG2, SMAD2/3, BMI-1, and c-MYC in a human embryonic stem cell line. We then developed a novel Sequential ChIP protocol to investigate in vivo promoter co-occupancy, which is basically characterized by the absence of antibody-antigen disruption during the assay. It combines centrifugation of agarose beads and magnetic separation. Using this Sequential ChIP protocol we found that c-MYC associates with the SOX2/NANOG/OCT3/4 complex and identified a novel RUNX2/BMI-1/SMAD2/3 complex in BG01V cells. These two TF complexes associate with two distinct sets of target genes. The RUNX2/BMI-1/SMAD2/3 complex is associated predominantly with genes not expressed in undifferentiated BG01V cells, consistent with the reported role of those TFs as transcriptional repressors. CONCLUSION: These simplified basic ChIP and novel Sequential ChIP protocols were successfully tested with a variety of antibodies with human embryonic stem cells, generated a number of novel observations for future studies and might be useful for high-throughput ChIP-based assays.

Abstract
Cooperation between research communities and software-development teams has led to the creation of novel software. The purpose of this paper is to show an alternative work method based on the usage of ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), which can be effectively employed in solving common microscopic and ultrastructural image analysis tasks. As an open-source software, ImageJ provides the possibility to work in a free-development/sharing world. Its very "friendly" graphical user interface helps users to manage and edit biomedical images. The on-line material such as handbooks, wikis, and plugins leads users through various functions, giving clues about potential new applications. ImageJ is not only a morphometric analysis software, it is sufficiently flexible to be adapted to the numerous requirements tasked in the laboratories as routine as well as research demands. Examples include area measurements on selectively stained tissue components, cell count and area measurements at single cell level, immunohistochemical antigen quantification, and immunoelectron microscopy gold particle count.

Abstract
Purpose: To measure the three-dimensional motion of liver tumors using cine-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and compare it to the liver motion assessed using fluoroscopy.Methods and Materials: Liver and liver tumor motion were investigated in the first 36 patients with primary (n = 20) and metastatic (n = 16) liver cancer accrued to our Phase I stereotactic radiotherapy study. At simulation, all patients underwent anteroposterior fluoroscopy, and the maximal diaphragm excursion in the craniocaudal (CC) direction was observed. Cine-MRI using T-2-weighted single shot fast spin echo sequences were acquired in three orthogonal planes during free breathing through the centroid of the most dominant liver tumor. ImageJ software was used to measure the maximal motion of the tumor edges in each plane. The intra- and interobserver reproducibility was also quantified.Results: The average CC motion of the liver at fluoroscopy was 15 mm (range, 5-41). On cine-MRI, the average CC tumor motion was 15.5 mm (range, 6.9-35.4), the anteroposterior motion was 10 mm (range, 3.7-21.6), and the mediolateral motion was 7.5 mm (range, 3.8-14.8). The fluoroscopic CC diaphragm motion did not correlate well with the MRI CC tumor motion (r = 0.25). The mean intraobserver error was <2 mm in the CC, anteroposterior, and mediolateral directions, and 90% of measurements between observers were within 3 mm.Conclusions: The results of our study have shown that cine-MRI can be used to directly assess liver tumor motion in three dimensions. Tumor motion did not correlate well with the diaphragm motion measured using kilovoltage fluoroscopy. The tumor motion data from cine-MRI can be used to facilitate individualized planning target volume margins to account for breathing motion. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract
Existing methods to quantify angiogenesis range from image analysis of photographs to fluorescent microscopy. These methods are often time consuming and costly; they also may not detect capillaries if they are indistinct from the background of the image. We have developed a simple method based on the motion of blood to create an image that reveals the entire angiogenic vasculature. Two image analysis software programs were used separately to demonstrate the method. Using either ImageJ or Environment for Visualizing Images, we analyzed a video clip of regenerated tissue from the partially amputated caudal fin of a zebrafish (Danio rerio). The deviations among the frames in the video stack were calculated to reveal pixels where motion has occurred. The resulting image highlighted all vessels through which blood flowed and allowed for automatic quantification of the newly developed vasculature. Using this method, we quantified the angiogenic action of basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, as well as suppression of angiogenesis by an inhibitor. In a preliminary study, we also found that it could be used to trace the developing vasculature in zebrafish embryos. Thus, motion-based angiogenesis analysis may provide an easy and accurate quantification of angiogenesis.

Abstract
This study presents the development of an ImageJ plugin for surface characterization. Based on gradient analysis, parameters, such as the gradient magnitude, orientation, mean resultant vector and surface area are derived. A comparative study of supercalendered (SC) papers was performed to verify the surface representations yielded by a laser profilometer. The surface representations of samples covered with carbon and gold were compared to untreated samples. The results confirm the suitability of gold coating for reducing the artefacts encountered on laser profilometry surface representations of paper. In addition, a complete scanning electron microscopy analysis is performed on the assessed samples to quantify the surface fraction covered by mineral fillers and to reveal the true 3D microstructure of SC surfaces. The influence of filler coverage and filler type on the gloss level of commercial SC papers is evaluated. The relationship between the surface topography, gloss and PPS roughness for a series of commercial SC papers is established.

Abstract
PURPOSE: Fuchs corneal dystrophy (FCD) is a degenerative disorder of the cornea that is characterized by the progressive accumulation of guttae, which are small excrescences of Descemet's membrane. We describe a method for documenting the location and number of guttae, and ask whether disease progression can be observed during relatively short periods. METHODS: Patients with FCD were imaged by standard retroillumination photography with a slit lamp. Scanned photographs were analyzed by using NIH ImageJ software to determine the number of individual guttae and areas of confluence. RESULTS: In 4 FCD patients, photographs taken 23 to 30 months apart revealed that, once formed, individual guttae and their relative positions persisted during this period. Very few guttae disappeared, and the emergence of many new guttae was observed. Determination of the area with confluent guttae was used to quantify disease stage. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-assisted analysis of retroillumination photographs is proposed as an effective way to document the number and distribution of individual guttae. Although the disease typically progresses slowly during decades, we have been able to detect the formation of new guttae within only 2 years. This rapid assessment of disease progression could be used to measure phenotypic differences between genetic subtypes of FCD. It also could provide important baseline information and methodology for clinical trials of therapeutic options, should these become available.

Abstract
STUDY OBJECTIVE: Methemoglobinemia after pesticide poisoning is associated with a mortality of 12% in Sri Lanka. Treatment is complicated by the lack of laboratory facilities. We aimed to develop and validate a low-cost bedside test for quantitative estimation of clinically significant methemoglobin to be used in settings of limited resources. METHODS: A method to reliably produce blood samples with 10% to 100% methemoglobin was developed. Freshly prepared methemoglobin samples were used to develop the color chart. One drop (10 muL) of prepared methemoglobin sample was placed on white absorbent paper and scanned using a flatbed Cannon Scan LiDE 25 scanner. The mean red, green, and blue values were measured with ImageJ 1.37v. These color values were used to prepare a color chart to be used at the bedside. Interobserver agreement was assessed against prepared samples. The results from clinical use were compared with formal methemoglobin measurements. RESULTS: The red color value was linearly related to percentage methemoglobin (R(2)=0.9938), with no effect of absolute hemoglobin concentration. Mean interobserver (N=21) agreement and weighted kappa for scanned methemoglobin spots using the color chart were 94% and 0.83, respectively. Mean interobserver (N=9) agreement and weighted kappa for a freshly prepared methemoglobin sample with the chart were 88% and 0.71, respectively. Clinical use of the color chart also showed good agreement with spectrometric measurements. CONCLUSION: A color chart can be used to give a clinically useful quantitative estimate of methemoglobinemia.

Abstract
Cyanobacteria are the dominant primary producers in microbial mats, which are stratified benthic microbial ecosystems found in coastal environments. Some cyanobacteria form long filaments, which make difficult to apply classical methods to estimate their biomass because they establish strong interactions with detritic particles. In a previous study, we described a method for determining cyanobacterial biomass by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). However, the manual method used, based on summa projection images, was difficult to apply when analyzing a large number of samples. In this paper, we described a new automated method, based on stacks and applying the plugin voxel counter in the ImageJ analysis system, more adequate for obtaining biomass data quickly from a large number of CLSM images.

Abstract
Many different programs are available to analyze microarray images. Most programs are commercial packages, some are free. In the latter group only few propose automatic grid alignment and batch mode. More often than not a program implements only one quantification algorithm. AGScan is an open source program that works on all major platforms. It is based on the ImageJ library [Rasband (1997-2006)] and offers a plug-in extension system to add new functions to manipulate images, align grid and quantify spots. It is appropriate for daily laboratory use and also as a framework for new algorithms.

Abstract
PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to describe the automation of quality control procedures on photo-stimulable imaging plates by means of an image-processing tool providing automatic reading of the images and automatic calculation of the quality parameters monitored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quality-control procedures were performed according to the main available guidelines. The quality assurance programme was applied to several Kodak and Philips devices in four radiological departments. The automatic image-processing tool was developed using public domain software (Java-based ImageJ software) and contains both reading and computation procedures. RESULTS: The quality checks and algorithms described were successfully applied, proving useful for identification of defective plates and for implementation of the quality assurance programme. The use of automation allowed significant savings in the time required for quality checks. CONCLUSIONS: Completely automated image reading allows substantial economic and human resources savings, as it eliminates much of the transfer, reproduction, processing and filing procedures.

Abstract
Advances in enteric nervous system (ENS) stem cell biology have raised the possibility of treating Hirschsprung's disease with ENS stem/progenitor cell (ENSPC) transplantation. This study aimed to expand ENSPC numbers by the growth and redissociation of neurospheres and assess their differential potential. METHODS: Human ENS neurospheres were cultured as previously described and redissociated to generate secondary and tertiary neurospheres. Neurospheres were assessed for the presence of neuronal (PGP9.5), glial (S100), and stem cell (p75, nestin markers). The degree of immunofluorescence was quantified using the ImageJ program. Secondary/tertiary neurospheres were transplanted into mouse distal colon grown in tissue culture. RESULTS: Secondary/tertiary neurospheres could be generated with exponentially increasing numbers. Tertiary neurospheres showed a significant increase in the proportion of p75 staining but a significant decrease in the proportion of S100 staining. After transplantation, secondary/tertiary neurosphere-derived cells positive for PGP9.5 and S100 could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to exponentially expand neurosphere and therefore ENSPC numbers by repeated dissociation and culture. There is a loss of S100-positive cells in secondary/tertiary neurospheres, but the ENSPCs remain capable of differentiating into neurons and glia when transplanted into an embryonic gut environment.

Abstract
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between an adequate pair of fluorophores is an indication of closer proximity than colocalization and is used by biologists to study fluorescently modified protein interactions inside cells. We present a method for visualization of FRET images acquired by confocal sensitized emission, involving excitation of the donor fluorophore and detection of the energy transfer as an emission from the acceptor fluorophore into the FRET channel. Authentic FRET signal measurements require the correction from the FRET channel of the undesired bleed-through signals (BT) resulting from both the leak-through of the donor emission and the direct acceptor emission. Our method reduces the interference of the user to a minimum by analyzing the entire image, pixel by pixel. It proposes imaging treatments and the display of control images to validate the BT calculation and the image corrections. It displays FRET images as a function of the colocalization of the two fluorescent partners. Finally, it proposes an alternative to normalization of the FRET intensities to compare FRET signal variations between samples. This method called "FRET and Colocalization Analyzer" has been implemented in a Plug-in of the freely available ImageJ software. It is particularly adapted when transient expression of the fluorescent proteins is used thereby giving very variable expression levels or when the colocalization of the two partners is varying in proportion, in amount, and in size, as a function of time. The method and program are validated using the analysis of the spatio-temporal interactions between a G-protein coupled receptor, the tachykinin NK2 receptor, and the beta-arrestin 2 as an example.

Abstract
In clinical trials, response rate is an important endpoint for assessing the efficacy of an anticancer drug. The Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) has been widely used as a standard method to assess response. The RECIST requires only 1-dimensional measurement of tumor size. However, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), which commonly presents as infiltrative or micronodular lesions, is not always readily assessable by RECIST. During the past 2 years, we have been developing computer-based programs to more accurately measure tumor size on chest computed tomography (CT) scans. In a first-generation computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) system, we were able to capture and quantify lesions on CT scans by linking the software programs of eFilm, HyperSnap, and Scion. We have applied this CAIA approach to measuring BAC response to gefitinib in the Southwest Oncology Group (S0126) trial. However, this first-generation CAIA system involves multiple manual steps and is therefore labor intensive. We are now developing a fully automated CAIA program based on a versatile software platform, ImageJ, created at the National Institutes of Health. Taking theoretical and physical considerations into account, Java plug-in programs for ImageJ are created to automatically analyze CT scans in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format. We have demonstrated the feasibility of an ImageJ-based automated CAIA program for measuring BAC bidimensionally on CT scans. This automated CAIA system will be applied in a prospective clinical trial of the GVAX vaccine in patients with BAC.

Abstract
It is generally accepted that the functional compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells is reflected by the differential occurrence of proteins in their compartments. The location and physiological function of a protein are closely related; local information of a protein is thus crucial to understanding its role in biological processes. The visualization of proteins residing on intracellular structures by fluorescence microscopy has become a routine approach in cell biology and is increasingly used to assess their colocalization with well-characterized markers. However, image-analysis methods for colocalization studies are a field of contention and enigma. We have therefore undertaken to review the most currently used colocalization analysis methods, introducing the basic optical concepts important for image acquisition and subsequent analysis. We provide a summary of practical tips for image acquisition and treatment that should precede proper colocalization analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the application and feasibility of colocalization tools for various biological colocalization situations and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We have created a novel toolbox for subcellular colocalization analysis under ImageJ, named JACoP, that integrates current global statistic methods and a novel object-based approach.

Abstract
FRET has emerged as an important tool for studying intracellular processes and interactions between biomolecules. Intracellular donor and acceptor molecules are distributed in individual organelles that usually have complex non-continuous shape. Consequently, background pixels arising from fluorophore-free regions of the cell are proximal to FRET-positive pixels, leading to systemic errors in the estimated FRET values. This study introduces a new FRET(TH) algorithm for FRET estimation by acceptor photobleaching that separates the FRET-positive pixels from the background by applying user-defined thresholds for pixel selection. The FRET(TH) algorithm was validated by analysis of interactions between fluorescently tagged proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum using acquired and simulated images. The novel algorithm showed superior performance to the regular FRET calculation algorithm in acquired images and in most simulations. The developed algorithm was incorporated into the FRETcalc plugin for ImageJ program that enables user-defined choices of thresholds for calculation of FRET by acceptor photobleaching.

Abstract
The demand for image-processing software for radiology applications has been increasing, fueled by advancements in both image-acquisition and image-analysis techniques. The utility of existing image-processing software is often limited by cost, lack of flexibility, and/or specific hardware requirements. In particular, many existing packages cannot directly utilize images formatted using the specifications in part 10 of the DICOM standard ("DICOM images"). We show how image analyses can be performed directly on DICOM images by using ImageJ, a free, Java-based image-processing package (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). We demonstrate how plug-ins written in our laboratory can be used along with the ImageJ macro script language to create flexible, low-cost, multiplatform image-processing applications that can be directed by information contained in the DICOM image header.

Abstract
Computer based three-dimensional reconstruction and co-registration of experimental data provide powerful tools for integration of observation derived from various technical approaches leading to better understanding of brain functions. Here we describe a method to build a 3D multi-modal and multi-dimensional model of brain structures providing framework for data sharing. All image processing, registration and 3D reconstruction were performed using open source software IMOD package software and ImageJ. The reconstruction procedure is based on series of AChE and Nissl stained sections aligned to blockface pictures. Integration of experimental data into the reference model is achieved by co-registration of Nissl sections of experimental brain cases by positioning landmarks on corresponding anatomical structures. To overcome the challenge of comparing for experimental sections with those of the reference model, adjustment of experimental model to the brain model was done section by section and limited to the structures of interest. For this adjustment we stress the use of cytoarchitectural criteria for accurate registration of anatomical structures and co-registration procedures.

Abstract
Significant technical advances in imaging, molecular biology and genomics have fueled a revolution in cell biology, in that the molecular and structural processes of the cell are now visualized and measured routinely. Driving much of this recent development has been the advent of computational tools for the acquisition, visualization, analysis and dissemination of these datasets. These tools collectively make up a new subfield of computational biology called bioimage informatics, which is facilitated by open source approaches. We discuss why open source tools for image informatics in cell biology are needed, some of the key general attributes of what make an open source imaging application successful, and point to opportunities for further operability that should greatly accelerate future cell biology discovery.

Abstract
Mycelial morphology is a critically important process property in industrial fermentations of filamentous micro-organisms, as particular phenotypes are associated with maximum productivity. However, the accurate quantification of complex morphologies still represents a significant challenge in elucidating this relationship. A system has been developed for high-resolution characterisation of filamentous fungal growth on a solid substrate, using membrane immobilization and fully-automatic plug-ins developed for the public domain, Java-based, image-processing software, ImageJ. The system has been used to quantify the microscopic development of Aspergillus oryzae on malt agar, by measuring spore projected area and circularity, the total length of a hyphal element, the number of tips per element, and the hyphal growth unit. Two different stages of growth are described, from the swelling of a population of conidiospores up to fully developed, branched hyphae 24 h after inoculation. Spore swelling expressed as an increase in mean equivalent spore diameter was found to be approximately linear with time. Widespread germination of spores was observed by 8 h after inoculation. From approximately 12 h, the number of tips was found to increase exponentially. The specific growth rate of a population of hyphae was calculated as approximately 0.24-0.27 h(-1). A wide variation in growth kinetics was found within the population. The robustness of the image-analysis system was verified by testing the effect of small variations in the input data.

Abstract
Analysis of in vitro cell motility is a useful tool for assessing cellular response to a range of factors. However, the majority of cell-tracking systems available are designed primarily for use with fluorescently labelled images. In this paper, five commonly used tracking systems are examined for their performance compared with the use of a novel in-house cell-tracking system based on the principles of image registration and optical flow. Image registration is a tool commonly used in medical imaging to correct for the effects of patient motion during imaging procedures and works well on low-contrast images, such as those found in bright-field and phase-contrast microscopy. The five cell-tracking systems examined were Retrac, a manual tracking system used as the gold standard; CellTrack, a recently released freely downloadable software system that uses a combination of tracking methods; ImageJ, which is a freely available piece of software with a plug-in for automated tracking (MTrack2) and Imaris and Volocity, both commercially available automated tracking systems. All systems were used to track migration of human epithelial cells over ten frames of a phase-contrast time-lapse microscopy sequence. This showed that the in-house image-registration system was the most effective of those tested when tracking non-dividing epithelial cells in low-contrast images, with a successful tracking rate of 95%. The performance of the tracking systems was also evaluated by tracking fluorescently labelled epithelial cells imaged with both phase-contrast and confocal microscopy techniques. The results showed that using fluorescence microscopy instead of phase contrast does improve the tracking efficiency for each of the tested systems. For the in-house software, this improvement was relatively small (<5% difference in tracking success rate), whereas much greater improvements in performance were seen when using fluorescence microscopy with Volocity and ImageJ.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: New techniques for diagnostics and therapy in dermatology are becoming increasingly non-invasive, among which confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) is the most prevalent. It allows visualization of cellular structures of the skin up to a depth of 300 microm in vivo. Until now, most studies have been conducted on pathologically altered skin, mostly oncologic lesions. We now present a detailed analysis of capillaries located in the upper dermal papillae. METHODS: Multiple measurements were performed on the dorsal and ventral surface of the right forearm of 30 healthy volunteers (22-88 years) under standard conditions (room temperature, body position, time of day). Images were obtained with the Vivascope 1500 (Lucid) under standard settings and analyzed using the freeware ImageJ with a customwritten macro plugin. The following parameters of the capillaries in vivo were measured: area, perimeter, circularity and maximum diameter. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that all four parameters were constant within a narrow range, regardless of the body site, sex and age. In this physiological study, we can clearly demonstrate that by confocal laser-scanning capillaroscopy (CLSC), it is possible to visualize and measure skin capillaries at the extremities in a reproducible manner. CONCLUSION: This new approach offers a considerable advantage compared with nailfold capillaroscopy, which can only be performed at the proximal nail segment, and over histological analysis, which can be hampered by fixation artifacts resulting in altered size and shape of the vessels to be analyzed. CLSC could allow for precise analysis of in vivo skin vasculature in systemic and proliferative diseases of the skin.

Point analysis in Java applied to histological images of the perforant pathway: A user's account (editorialmaterial)
Keywords
Hippocampus, Projection, Entorhinal Cortex, Image Analysis
Abstract
The freeware Java tool Point Analysis in Java (PAJ), created to perform 3D point analysis, was tested in an independent laboratory setting. The input data consisted of images of the hippocampal perforant pathway from serial immunocytochemical localizations of the rat brain in multiple views at different resolutions. The low magnification set (x2 objective) comprised the entire perforant pathway, while the high magnification set (x100 objective) allowed the identification of individual fibers. A preliminary stereological study revealed a striking linear relationship between the fiber count at high magnification and the optical density at low magnification. PAJ enabled fast analysis for down-sampled data sets and a friendly interface with automated plot drawings. Noted strengths included the multi-platform support as well as the free availability of the source code, conducive to a broad user base and maximum flexibility for ad hoc requirements. PAJ has great potential to extend its usability by (a) improving its graphical user interface, (b) increasing its input size limit, (c) improving response time for large data sets, and (d) potentially being integrated with other Java graphical tools such as ImageJ.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE: Assessing the Ki-67 labeling index (LI) is laborious and time consuming. Therefore, an automated computer-based method was developed, which is able to identify and analyze immunolabeled and hematoxylin-stained nuclei in digital images of routine immunohistochemical slides. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The method is based on a plugin for the public domain image analysis software ImageJ, which runs on every operating system (free download at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Percentage of Ki-67 immunostained nuclei were determined in 5 high power fields (x40) of immunostained slides (DAB detection technique, hematoxylin counterstain) of 20 Grade I, 20 Grade II, and 10 Grade III meningiomas conventionally by two independent investigators and automatically, respectively. The time effort was measured for each counting procedure. RESULTS: Enumerating conventionally or automatically did not reveal any significant differences in the mean labeling indices. Ki-67 LIs discriminated sufficiently between meningiomas of Grade I (median 1.7% Investigator 1 and 1.5% Investigator 2 vs. 1.5% automatically), Grade II (7.6%, 8% vs. 7.3%), and Grade III meningiomas (22%, 21% vs. 22%). The computer-based results correlated very closely with those obtained by manual counting (correlation coefficient = 0.98). The mean time effort for counting procedure per image was 374 s (130 s-435 s) for the conventional and 11 s (7 s-12 s) for the automated method. CONCLUSIONS: The described method can reliably assess the Ki-67 LI much faster than conventional enumerating. The computerized method has the advantages of objectivity, accuracy, repeatability, and ease of use. There is no request for special stains nor special image acquiring systems. The plugin can be downloaded at the "Morphometrie" section of http://www.uniklinikum-saarland.de/neuropathologie.

Abstract
The invasive stages of malaria and other apicomplexan parasites use a unique motility machinery based on actin, myosin and a number of parasite-specific proteins to invade host cells and tissues. The crucial importance of this motility machinery at several stages of the life cycle of these parasites makes the individual components potential drug targets. The different stages of the malaria parasite exhibit strikingly diverse movement patterns, likely reflecting the varied needs to achieve successful invasion. Here, we describe a Tool for Automated Sporozoite Tracking (ToAST) that allows the rapid simultaneous analysis of several hundred motile Plasmodium sporozoites, the stage of the malaria parasite transmitted by the mosquito. ToAST reliably categorizes different modes of sporozoite movement and can be used for both tracking changes in movement patterns and comparing overall movement parameters, such as average speed or the persistence of sporozoites undergoing a certain type of movement. This allows the comparison of potentially small differences between distinct parasite populations and will enable screening of drug libraries to find inhibitors of sporozoite motility. Using ToAST, we find that isolated sporozoites change their movement patterns towards productive motility during the first week after infection of mosquito salivary glands.

Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for generating 3-dimensional structural and functional image data. MRI has already proven valuable in creating atlases of mouse and quail development. Here, we have exploited high resolution MRI to determine the parameters necessary to acquire images of the chick embryo eye. Using a 9.4 Tesla (400 MHz) high field ultra-shielded and refrigerated magnet (Bruker), MRI was carried out on paraformaldehyde-fixed chick embryos or heads at E4, E6, E8, and E10. Image data were processed using established and custom packages (MRICro, ImageJ, ParaVision, Bruker and mri3dX). Voxel dimensions ranged from 62.5 microm to 117.2 microm. We subsequently used the images obtained from the MRI data in order to make precise measurements of chick embryo eye surface area, volume and axial length from E4 to E10. MRI was validated for accurate sizing of ocular tissue features by direct comparison with previously published literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of high resolution MRI for making accurate measurements of morphological changes due to experimental manipulation of chick eye development, thereby facilitating a better understanding of the effects on chick embryo eye development and growth of such manipulations. Chondroitin sulphate or heparin were microinjected into the vitreous cavity of the right eyes of each of 3 embryos at E5. At E10, embryos were fixed and various eye parameters (volume, surface area, axial length and equatorial diameter) were determined using MRI and normalised with respect to the un-injected left eyes. Statistically significant alterations in eye volume (p < 0.05; increases with chondroitin sulphate and decreases with heparin) and changes in vitreous homogeneity were observed in embryos following microinjection of glycosaminoglycans. Furthermore, in the heparin-injected eyes, significant disturbances at the vitreo-retinal boundary were observed as well as retinal folding and detachment confirming histological observations. These data reveal the utility and superiority of MRI for producing images enabling quantification of experimentally induced changes in eye volume and structure. The results indicate that MRI is an important tool that could become a routine approach for rapid and sensitive phenotypic analysis of normal chick ocular development and morphology as well as potentially the effects of surgical or genetic manipulations of chick embryo eyes in live embryos in ovo.

Abstract
We have developed a new technique called Computer-Aided Meiotic Maturation Assay (CAMMA) for imaging large arrays of zebrafish oocytes and automatically collecting image files at regular intervals during meiotic maturation. This novel method uses a transparency scanner interfaced to a computer with macro programming that automatically scans and archives the image files. Images are stacked and analyzed with ImageJ to quantify changes in optical density characteristic of zebrafish oocyte maturation. Major advantages of CAMMA include (1) ability to image very large arrays of oocytes and follow individual cells over time, (2) simultaneously image many treatment groups, (3) digitized images may be stacked, animated, and analyzed in programs such as ImageJ, NIH-Image, or ScionImage, and (4) CAMMA system is inexpensive, costing less than most microscopes used in traditional assays. We have used CAMMA to determine the dose response and time course of oocyte maturation induced by 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (HP). Maximal decrease in optical density occurs around 5 hr after 0.1 micro g/ml HP (28.5 degrees C), approximately 3 hr after germinal vesicle migration (GVM) and dissolution (GVD). In addition to changes in optical density, GVD is accompanied by streaming of ooplasm to the animal pole to form a blastodisc. These dynamic changes are readily visualized by animating image stacks from CAMMA; thus, CAMMA provides a valuable source of time-lapse movies for those studying zebrafish oocyte maturation. The oocyte clearing documented by CAMMA is correlated to changes in size distribution of major yolk proteins upon SDS-PAGE, and, this in turn, is related to increased cyclin B(1) protein.

Abstract
This article intends to close the gap between the abundance of regular articles focusing on adhesive mechanisms of cells in a flow field and purely technical reports confined to the description of newly developed algorithms, not yet ready to be used by users without programming skills. A simple and robust method is presented for analysing raw videomicroscopic data of flow-based adhesion assays using the freely available public domain software ImageJ. We describe in detail the image processing routines used to rapidly and reliably evaluate the number of adherent and translocating platelets in videomicroscopic recordings. The depicted procedures were exemplified by analysing platelet interaction with immobilized von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen in flowing blood under physiological wall shear rates. Neutralizing GPIbalpha function reduced shear-dependent platelet translocation on von Willebrand factor and abolished firm platelet adhesion. Abciximab, Tirofiban and Eptifibatide completely inhibited GPIIb/IIIa-dependent stable platelet deposition on fibrinogen. The presented method to analyse videomicroscopic recordings from flow-based adhesion assays offers the advantage of providing a simple and reliable way to quantify flow-based adhesion assays, which is completely based on ImageJ and can easily be applied to study adhesion mechanisms of cells in non-fluorescent modes without the need to deviate from the presented protocol.

Abstract
A method was developed to assess mitochondrial movement in the living cell that is dependent, in part, on microtubule and/or associating protein interactions. The leader sequence from cytochrome-c was used to drive DsRed2 fluorescent proteins to accumulate in the mitochondria, thus enabling to follow mitochondrial (cytochrome-c's) movement. For calculating the percentage of mitochondrial movement, an image-processing program was used (ImageJ). Paclitaxel, an antitumor agent, is a potent microtubule-stabilizing agent that increases the stability of tubulin polymers, inhibiting mitosis and mitochondrial activity in dividing cells. Here, we tested whether paclitaxel inhibits mitochondrial movement in pheochromocytoma cells (a neuronal model, when tested in a differentiated state). While a 2-day exposure to paclitaxel resulted in cellular toxicity (measured as inhibition of mitochondrial activity), 2-3 h exposure to paclitaxel were sufficient to inhibit mitochondrial movement as assessed in 10-20-s imaging sessions in living cells. Mitotracker deep-red staining validated the staining obtained with DsRed2-cytochrome-c and identified intact mitochondria. Results showed a significant paclitaxel dose-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial movement. This new method should enable further assessment of microtubule-interacting drugs and other cytoskeletal components for their potential influence of mitochondrial movement as a test for activity and side effects.

Abstract
MOTIVATION: Modern anatomical and developmental studies often require high-resolution imaging of large specimens in three dimensions (3D). Confocal microscopy produces high-resolution 3D images, but is limited by a relatively small field of view compared with the size of large biological specimens. Therefore, motorized stages that move the sample are used to create a tiled scan of the whole specimen. The physical coordinates provided by the microscope stage are not precise enough to allow direct reconstruction (Stitching) of the whole image from individual image stacks. RESULTS: To optimally stitch a large collection of 3D confocal images, we developed a method that, based on the Fourier Shift Theorem, computes all possible translations between pairs of 3D images, yielding the best overlap in terms of the cross-correlation measure and subsequently finds the globally optimal configuration of the whole group of 3D images. This method avoids the propagation of errors by consecutive registration steps. Additionally, to compensate the brightness differences between tiles, we apply a smooth, non-linear intensity transition between the overlapping images. Our stitching approach is fast, works on 2D and 3D images, and for small image sets does not require prior knowledge about the tile configuration. AVAILABILITY: The implementation of this method is available as an ImageJ plugin distributed as a part of the Fiji project (Fiji is just ImageJ: http://fiji.sc/).
