Menu Commandspar:Commands

As described in par:User-Interface1, the menu bar lists
all ImageJ commands. It is organized in eight menus:
lyxlistwindowss
[sec:File] Basic file operations
(opening, saving, creating new images). Most are self-explanatory.
[sec:Edit] Editing and drawing operations
as well as global settings.
[sec:Image] Conversion and modification
of images including geometric transformations.
[sec:Process] Image processing,
including point operations, filters and arithmetic operations.
[sec:Analyze-Menu] Statistical measurements,
profile and histogram plotting and other operations related to image
analysis.
[sec:Plugins] Commands for creating,
editing and managing add-ons (see sec:Extending-ImageJ),
listing all the user-installed sub:Macros-ExtendingIJ,
sub:Scripts and sub:Plugins installed in the
ImageJ/plugins/ directory.
[sec:WindowMenu] Selection and management
of open windows.
[sec:Help] Updates, documentation
resources and version information.
lyxlist

infobox:Organizing-CommandsOrganizing Commands in the Menu
Bar


The sec:Plugins menu can become easily cluttered after
the installation of several plugins. Since Plugins reflects
the hierarchy of directories in ImageJ/plugins/ (up to two subfolders),
submenus (i.e., subfolders) can be created to keep the menu organized,
preventing it from running off the bottom of the screen. E.g, to move
the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/eps-writer.htmlEPS Writer
plugin into a PluginsInput-OutputPDF
submenu, one would move EPSWriter.class into ImageJ/plugins/Input-Output/PDF/.


In addition, checking the Move isolated plugins to Misc. menu
checkbox in EditOptionssub:Misc...
will compact the menu list by moving to PluginsMiscellaneous
all the plugins with only one command that try to install themselves
in submenus. 


Note that external plugins can be installed in any of the ImageJ menus.
This is the case of plugins packaged in JAR files containing a configuration
file (plugins.configplugins.config) specifying the location
of the new commands implemented by the plugin. You can rename, reorganize
or move commands implemented by external plugins by editing their
plugins.config file as described on the http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/jar-demo.htmlJAR demo documentation page.
If you don't know in which menu a plugin has been registered, use
Show full information in the command Finder (PluginsUtilitiessub:Command-Finder)
to find out the location of the installed .jar files.


With sub:Fiji-intro, sub:Scripts and sub:Macros-ExtendingIJ
can be registered in any menu by saving into Fiji.app/plugins/Scripts/menu name/submenu name/.
E.g., a certain macro (.ijm file) saved in Fiji.app/plugins/Scripts/File/Import/
is registered in the Filesub:Import submenu.

Open Samplessub:OpenSamples

Opens Sample Imagesexample images hosted on the ImageJ Web
site. These sample images are useful for creating, testing and debugging
macros since routines can be applied to the same image, regardless
of where the macro is run. Among all, probably the most used is

Opens a Image sequenceseries of images in a chosen folder
as a stack. Images may have different dimensions and can be of any
format supported by ImageJ (see sec:Image-Types
and HandleExtraFileTypeshttp://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/file-handler.htmlHandleExtraFileTypes
plugin). Non-image files (sub:Scripts, .lut, .roi, RoiSet.zip,
etc. ) are ignored.




Information - widthheightdepth (size) - of the
stack to be created is displayed at the bottom of the dialog.
description
[Number of Images] Specifies how many images to open.
[Starting Image] If set to n, import will start
with the n image in the folder.
[Increment] If set to '2' every other image will be opened,
if set to '3' to every third image will be opened, etc.description

minipage
description
[File Name Contains] Enter a string into this field
and ImageJ will only open files whose name contains that string.
[Enter Pattern] Regular expressions (RegexregexregexRegular expression)
can be typed here for advanced filtering (see tab:regex-syntax).
[Scale Images] Setting a value less than 100 will reduce
memory requirements. E.g., entering 50 reduces the amount of memory
needed to open a stack by 25 (two-dimensional images: 
of the original data). This value  is ignored if Use Virtual
Stack is checked.
[Convert to RGB] Allows a mixture of RGB and grayscale
images to be opened by converting all the sequence to RGB. Note that
if this option is unchecked and the first imported image is 8-bit
then all the remaining images in the sequence will be converted to
8-bit. Checking this option, circumvents this issue.
[Sort Names Numerically] When checked,
the stack will be opened in numeric file name order (e.g.,
'name1.tif', 'name2.tif', 'name10.tif') instead of alphanumeric
order (e.g., 'name1.tif', 'name10.tif', 'name2.tif'). DICOM
files in the same series (tag0020,0011) are always sorted
by the image number (tag0020,0013). The List Stack Tags
macro, part of the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/ListDicomTags.txtListDicomTags
macro set, lists the values of the image number and image series tags.
[Use Virtual Stack] When checked, images are opened
as a read-only virtual (disk-resident) stack using a version of the
http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/virtual-opener.htmlVirtual Stack Opener
plugin. This allows image sequences too big to fit in MemoryRAM
to be opened, but access time is slower and changes are lost when
switching to a different image in the stack (see sub:Virtual-Stacks).
Note the following consequences of enabling this option:

infobox:ImportImgSeqReducing Memory Requirements When Importing
Images


Since ImageJ1.44d, the Filesub:Importsub:Image-Sequence...
command no longer features the Convert to 8-bit Grayscale checkbox.
This option was used to reduce memory requirements but used different
scaling for each imported image.


As a replacement, use the Use virtual stack option
and then convert to 8-bit using FileType8-bit.
Memory requirements can also be reduced by using the Scale Images
() option. The amount of Memorymemory allocated to ImageJ
can be adjusted in EditOptionssub:Memory-=000026-Threads...

Rawsub:Import>Raw

minipage[c][1][t]0.53
images/ImportRaw
minipage
minipage[c][1][t]0.47
Use this command to import images that are not in a file format directly
supported by ImageJ. You will need to know certain information about
the layout of the image file, including the size of the image, and
the offset to the beginning of the image data.


Interleaved RGB images have pixels stored contiguously (rgbrgbrgb)
in a single image plane. Planar RGB images have the red, green and
blue image data stored in separate 8-bit sample planes. ImageJ saves
RGB images (both TIFF and raw) in interleaved format.
minipage
description
[Image Type] There are fourteen choices depicted above.
16-bit signed integer images are converted to unsigned by
adding 32,768. 1-bit Bitmap images are converted to 8-bit.
[Image Width] The number of pixel in each row of image
data.
[Image Height] The number of rows in the image.
[Offset to First Image] The number of bytes in the
file before the first byte of image data.
[Number of Images] The number of images stored in the
file. If this value is greater than the actual number of images the
resulting stack will get truncated to the actual size.
[Gap Between Images] The number of bytes from the end
of one image to the beginning of the next. Set this value to widthheightbytes-per-pixeln
to skip n images for each image read.
[White is Zero] Should be checked if black pixels are
represented using numbers that are less than the numbers used for
white pixels. If your images look like photographic negatives, changing
this field should fix the problem.
[Little-Endian Byte Order] Probably needs to be checked
when importing 16-bit or 32-bit grayscale images from little-endian
machines such as Intel based PCs.
[Open All Files in Folder] If checked, ImageJ will
import all the images in the folder as a stack. The images must all
be the same size and type.
[Use Virtual Stack] Images are imported as virtual stacks.
[Help] Opens http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/file.html#raw.

LUTsub:Import>LUT

Opens an ImageJ or NIH Image lookup table, or a raw lookup table.
The raw LUTLUT file must be 768bytes long and contain
256reds, 256blues and 256greens. If no image is open, a 25632
ramp image is created to display the LUT. Note that lookup tables
with file names ending in .lut can also be opened using Filesub:Open...
or drag and drop.


[Text Image]Text Imagesub:Import>Text-Image

Opens a tab-delimited text file as a 32-bit real image (see
fig:TextImages). The image's width and height are determined
by scanning the file and counting the number of words and lines. For
text files with integer values no larger than 255, use Imagesub:Type8-bit
to convert to 8-bit. Before converting, disable Scale When
Converting in EditOptionssub:Conversions...
to prevent the image from being scaled to 0-255.

[Stack From List]Stack From Listsub:Stack-From-List...Stacks!From List

Opens a stack, or virtual stack, from a text file or URL containing
a list of image file pathsC-StackFromList. The images can
be in different folders but they must all be the same size and type.
The http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/VirtualStackFromList.txtVirtual Stack From List
macro demonstrates how to generate a list of images and then use that

minipage
minipage[c][1][t]0.71
Uses a built in version of the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/avi-reader.htmlAVI reader
plugin to open an AVIAVI file (JPEG or PNG compressed, or
uncompressed) as a stack or virtual stack (one slice per video frame)
C-AviPlugins. Animation speed is retrieved from image frame
rate. AVI files can also be opened using Filesub:Open... or
drag and drop but macros must use this command to gain access to the
dialog box options.


ImageJ supports a restricted number of AVI formats including MJPGMJPG
(motion-JPEG) and various YUV 4:2:2/4:2:0 compressed formats (cf. http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/source/ij/plugin/AVI_Reader.javaplugin source code).

Save [s]sub:Save=00005Bs=00005D

Saves the active image in TIFF format, the 'default' format of ImageJ
(cf. infobox:Formats infobox:Formats). To save
only a selected area, create a rectangular selection and use the Imagesub:Duplicate...=00005BD=00005D
command. Note that sub:Save=00005Bs=00005D and FileSave Assub:Tiff...
are redundant commands.


Save Assub:SaveAs

Use this submenu to save the active image in TIFF, GIF, JPEG, or 'raw'
format. Can also be used to save measurement results, lookup tables,
selections, and selection XY coordinates.


Tiffsub:Tiff...

Saves the active image or stack in TIFFTIFF format in redundancy
with Filesub:Save=00005Bs=00005D.
TIFF is the only format (other than 'raw') that supports all ImageJ
data types (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit float and RGB) and the only format
that saves spatial and density calibration. In addition sec:Selections-Intro
and sub:Overlay-Intro are also saved in the TIFF header. 

By default, 16-bit and 32-bit images are saved using big-endian
byte order. Check Save TIFF and Raw in Intel Byte Order in
the EditOptionssub:Input/Output...
dialog box to save using little-endian byte order.

is set to 100, reducing the likelihood of color artifacts. By default,
the DPIDPI in the JPEG header is set to 72. For a higher
value, use a unit of inch in the Analyzesub:Set-Scale...
dialog. E.g., setting Distance in Pixels to 300, Known
Distance to 1 and Unit of Length to 'inch' will set the
DPIDots Per InchDPI to 300.

infobox:JpegAlertWarning on JPEG Compression


The JPEG format uses Lossy compressionmisc:LossyCompression
that leads to severe artifacts that are not compatible with quantitative
analyses. As such, it should only be used for http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/IP_PrinciplesWhy_.28lossy.29_JPEGs_should_not_be_used_in_imagingpresentation purposes
(if file size is an issue), but even then a lossless format such as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_GraphicsPNG
is probably more suitable.


The illustration below exemplifies the consequences of saving
images in a lossy format. To replicate it, open the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/baboon.jpgMandrill sample image
(by drag and drop, or alternatively using FileImportsub:Import>URL
and typing the image's path, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/baboon.jpg),
duplicate it (Imagesub:Duplicate...=00005BD=00005D),
save the duplicate as JPEG (FileSave Assub:Jpeg...),
run Filesub:Revert=00005Br=00005D
(so that the saved version is reloaded by ImageJ) and calculate the
difference between the two images using Processsub:Image-Calculator...


By adjusting the sub:Brightness/Contrast...=00005BC=00005D,
you will notice that the imperceptible JPEG artifacts are most pronounced
along regions of higher contrast changes. In addition to this edge
artifact, the JPEG algorithm may shift colors to improve compression
which may lead to artificial http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Colocalization_Analysiscolocalization.
These artifacts are intrinsic to the format and may persist even if
JPEG Quality has been increased to 100 in EditOptionssub:Input/Output...
Once an image has been lossy compressed there is no way of reverting
it to the original. Given all this, and since misc:Metadata
is poorly supported in lossy formats, it is unreasonable to use JPEG
in image processing.

If the line width is an even number, the selection boundary
is at the center of the line. If the line width is odd (1, 3, ),
the center of the line drawn is displaced from the selection edge
by  pixel to the bottom right. Thus the line center
(the line in case of ) is inside the selection at
the top and left borders, but outside at the bottom and right borders.
Rectangular selections (but not polygonal selections or traced selections
that happen to be rectangular) are an exception to this rule: For
rectangular selections, one-pixel wide outlines are always drawn
inside the rectangle. Thicker lines are drawn as for the other selection
types.

[Move isolated plugins to Misc. menu] This option
can reduce the size of the Plugins menu, preventing it from running
off the bottom of the screen. When this option is enabled, plugins
that attempt to install themselves in a submenu with only one command
are instead installed in the PluginsMiscellaneous submenu.
An example of such a plugin is http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/turboreg/TurboReg,
which normally creates a PluginsTurboReg submenu that
contains only one command.
[Run single instance listener] If
checked, ImageJ will use sockets to prevent multiple instances from
being launchedC-SocketListener. On Windows, this avoids the
problem where another copy of ImageJ starts each time an image is
dragged and dropped on the ImageJ icon. It also prevents multiple
instances when running ImageJ from the command line. Note that you
may get a security alert the first time ImageJ starts with this option
enabled. ImageJ does not require external socket access so it is okay
to deny it access in the security alert. This option is set by default
with new Windows installations.
[Debug mode] If checked, causes ImageJ to display debugging

Brightness/Contrast [C]sub:Brightness/Contrast...=00005BC=00005D

Use this tool to interactively alter the brightness and contrast of
the active image. With 8-bit images, brightness and contrast are
changed by updating the image's lookup table (LUT), so pixel values
are unchanged. With 16-bit and 32-bit images, the display is updated
by changing the mapping from pixel values to 8-bit display values,
so pixel pixel values are also unchanged. Brightness and contrast
of RGB images are changed by modifying the pixel values.

description
[Histogram] The line graph at the top of the window, which
is superimposed on the image's histogram, shows how pixel values are
mapped to 8-bit (0-255) display values. The two numbers under the
plot are the minimum and maximum displayed pixel values. These two
values define the display range, or 'window'. ImageJ displays images
by linearly mapping pixel values in the display range to display values
in the range 0-255. Pixels with a value less than the minimum are
displayed as black and those with a value greater than the maximum
are displayed as white.
[Minimum and Maximum sliders] Control the lower and
upper limits of the display range. Holding down Shift will simultaneously
adjust all channels of a composite image (e.g., FileOpen SamplesHeLa Cells (1.3M, 48-bit

[Contrast slider] Increases or decreases contrast by varying
the width of the display range. The narrower the display range, the
higher the contrast. Holding down Shift will simultaneously adjust
all channels of a composite image.
[Auto] ImageJ will automatically optimize brightness and
contrast based on an analysis of the image's histogram. Create a selection,
and the entire image will be optimized based on an analysis of the
selection. The optimization is done by allowing a small percentage
of pixels in the image to become saturated (displayed as black or
white). Each additional click on Auto increases the number
of saturated pixels and thus the amount of optimization.

 A [basicstyle=]!run("Enhance Contrast", "saturated=0.35")!
macro call is generated if the command recorder (PluginMacrosub:Record...)
is running.
[Reset] Restores the original brightness and contrast settings.
The display range is set to the full pixel value range of the image.
A resetMinAndMax() macro call is generated if the command
recorder is running. Holding down Shift restores original settings
in all channels of a composite image.
[Set] Allows to enter the minimum and maximum display range
values in a dialog box. A setMinAndMax() macro call is generated
if the command recorder is running. 


A 16-bit image consists of 65536possible gray levels. Most of
times, however, the relevant image information is contained only within
a narrow range of the grayscale. This is the case, e.g., in low light
microscopy, in which signal is restricted to the lower end of the
grayscale. The Set Display Range dialog  allows you to choose
how to scale the range of gray levels of 16-bit images.

When displayed, the intensity of each pixel that is written

on the screen. How these intensities are interpreted is specified
by the image type. From the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/concepts.htmlImageJ website:Brightness/Contrast
quote
16-bit and 32-bit grayscale images are not directly displayable
on computer monitors, which typically can show only display 256shades
of gray. Therefore, the data are mapped to 8-bit by windowing. The
window defines the range of gray values that are displayed: values
below the window are made black, while values above the window are
white. The window is defined by minimum and maximum values that can
be modified using ImageAdjustsub:Brightness/Contrast...=00005BC=00005D.
quote
It may happen that the initial windowing performed by ImageJ on these
high bit-depth (or HDRHDRHigh Dynamic Range) images
is suboptimal. Please note that windowing does not affect image data

This command creates a sequence of projections of a rotating volume
Three D Projection @3D Projection3D Projection(stack
or hyperstack) onto a plane using nearest-point (surface),
brightest-point, or mean-value projection or a weighted
combination of nearest point projection with either of the other two
methods (partial opacity)C-3Dproject. The user may choose
to rotate the volume about any of the three orthogonal axes (x, y,
or z), make portions of the volume transparent (using thresholding),
or add a greater degree of visual realism by employing depth cues.


Each frame in the animation sequence is the result of projecting from
a different viewing angle. To visualize this, imagine a field of parallel
rays passing through a volume containing one or more solid objects
and striking a screen oriented normal to the directions of the rays.
minipage

Each ray projects a value onto the screen, or Projectionprojection
plane, based on the values of points along its path. Three methods
are available for calculating the projections onto this plane: nearest-point,
brightest-point, and mean-value. The choice of projection
method and the settings of various visualization parameters determine
how both surface and interior structures will appear.
description
[Projection Method] Select Nearest Point projection
to produce an image of the surfaces visible from the current viewing
angle. At each point in the projection plane, a ray passes normal
to the plane through the volume. The value of the nearest non transparent
point which the ray encounters is stored in the projection image.
Brightest Point projection examines points along the rays,
projecting the brightest point encountered along each ray. This will
display the brightest objects, such as bone in a CTCTComputed TomographyCT
(computed tomographic) study. Mean Value projection, a modification
of brightest-point projection, sums the values of all transparent
points along each ray and projects their mean value. It produces images
with softer edges and lower contrast, but can be useful when attempting
to visualize objects contained within a structure of greater brightness
(e.g. a skull).
[Slice Spacing] The interval, in pixels, between the slices
that make up the volume. ImageJ projects the volume onto the viewing
plane at each Rotation Angle Increment, beginning with the
volume rotated by Initial Angle and ending once the volume
has been rotated by Total Rotation.
[Lower/Upper Transparency Bound] Determine the
transparency of structures in the volume. Projection calculations
disregard points having values less than the lower threshold or greater
than the upper threshold. Setting these thresholds permits making
background points (those not belonging to any structure) invisible.
By setting appropriate thresholds, you can strip away layers having
reasonably uniform and unique intensity values and highlight (or make
invisible) inner structures. Note that you can also use ImageAdjustsub:Threshold...=00005BT=00005D
to set the transparency bounds.
[Opacity] Can be used to reveal hidden spatial relationships,
especially on overlapping objects of different colors and dimensions.
The (surface) Opacity parameter permits the display of weighted
combinations of nearest-point projection with either of the other
two methods, often giving the observer the ability to view inner structures
through translucent outer surfaces. To enable this feature, set Opacity
to a value greater than zero and select either Mean Value or
Brightest Point projection.
[Surface/Interior Depth-Cueing] Depth cues can
contribute to the three-dimensional quality of projection images by
giving perspective to projected structures. The depth-cueing parameters
determine whether projected points originating near the viewer appear
brighter, while points further away are dimmed linearly with distance.
The trade-off for this increased realism is that data points shown
in a depth-cued image no longer possess accurate densitometric values.
Two kinds of depth-cueing are available: Surface Depth-Cueing
and Interior Depth-Cueing. Surface Depth-Cueing works
only on nearest-point projections and the nearest-point component
of other projections with opacity turned on. Interior Depth-Cueing
works only on brightest-point projections. For both kinds, depth-cueing
is turned off when set to zero (i.e. 100 of intensity in back
to 100 of intensity in front) and is on when set at n 100 (i.e. (n)
of intensity in back to 100 intensity in front). Having independent
depth-cueing for surface (nearest-point) and interior (brightest-point)
allows for more visualization possibilities.
[Interpolate] Check Interpolate to generate a temporary
z-scaled stack that is used to generate the projections. Z-scaling
eliminates the gaps seen in projections of volumes with slice spacing
greater than 1.0pixels. This option is equivalent to using the
http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/transformj/scale.htmlScale
plugin from the http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/transformj/TransformJ
package to scale the stack in the z-dimension by the slice spacing
(in pixels). This checkbox is ignored if the slice spacing is less
than or equal to 1.0pixels.
