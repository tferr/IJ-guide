The initial contents of this guide have been retrieved in 2009 from
the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ImageJ website using http://www.mbayer.de/html2text/html2text.
Since then, it has been complemented and updated using informations
posted on the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/list.htmlImageJ mailing list,
http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=startImageJ Documentation Portal,
http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/FijiFiji, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ImageJ,
and http://developer.imagej.net/ImageJDev websites and Tony
Collins http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/ImageJ for Microscopy
manual. Nevertheless, because there has never been accompanying documentation
for some of the 350+ described commands, several sections have been
written from scratch based on the relevant http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/source/index.htmlImageJ source code
and authors own experience. Legacy nomenclature that became obsolete
with version  has been intentionally omitted. 

The guide was typeset with Live2012 on Mac OS10.6.8.
All illustrations were created with ImageJ/Fiji, loaded with G. Landini's
http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/IJ_RobotIJ Robot and J. Schindelin's
http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Tutorial_MakerTutorial Maker
plugins. Screenshots were produced by the screencapture
shell utility controlled by the following IJ macro: 
lstlisting[otherkeywords==,showstringspaces=false,tabsize=4]
 exec("screencapture -ciWo > /dev/null 2>&1 &"); run("System Clipboard");
 setLineWidth(1); setForegroundColor(111, 121, 132);
 drawRect(0, 0, getWidth, getHeight);

The HTML version was produced with http://elyxer.nongnu.org/eLyXer 1.2
and formatted using CSS code from Alex Fernández and Michael Hüneburg;
JavaScript code from Ciarán O'Kelly, Stuart Langridge and Tiago Ferreira.
It uses http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/SyntaxHighlighter
and icons from the http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_ProjectTango Desktop Project.

The ImageJ Iconsec:About-the-Cover

The Hartnack@Hartnack IJ icon,IJ iconHartnack
microscope (ca. 1870's) depicted on the front page inspired
the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/osx.htmliconImageJ icon for Mac OS X.
It is based on a http://www.arsmachina.com/s-hart1209.htmphotograph
by http://www.tomgrill.com/Tom Grill at http://www.arsmachina.com/arsmachina.com. 

Edmund Hartnack (1826-1891) was a renown microscope manufacturer
that pioneered the use of correction collars in water-immersion lenses
and the adoption of the substage condenser(Merico, G. Microscopy in Camillo Golgi's times. J Hist Neurosci,
(2003) 8(2):113-20). The precision and robustness of Hartnack optics played a pivotal
role in the groundbreaking research by the Nobel laureates Robert
Koch(Brock, TD. Robert Koch, A life in medicine and bacteriology.
ASM, 1999), Camillo Golgi(Brenni P. Gli strumenti di fisica dell'Istituto Tecnico Toscano -
Ottica. IMSS, 1995 ) and Santiago Ramón y Cajal(DeFelipe  Jones. Santiago Ramón y Cajal and methods in neurohistology.
Trends Neurosci, (1992) 15(7):237-46).
