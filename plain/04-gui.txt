ImageJ User Interfacepar:User-Interface1

Unlike most image processing programs ImageJ does not have a main
work areaGUIGraphical User Interface. ImageJ's main
window is actually quite parsimonious containing only a menu bar (at
the top of the screen on the Mac) containing all the par:Commands,
a sub:Toolbar, a sub:Status-bar and a sub:Progress-bar.
Images, histograms, profiles, widgets, etc. are displayed in additional
windows. Measurement results are displayed in the sec:Results-Table.
Most windows can be dragged around the screen and resized.

Toolbarsub:Toolbar

The ImageJ toolbar contains tools for making selections, drawings,
zooming and scrolling, etc. In addition, the right-side of the toolbar
contains seven slots that can host any of the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/tools/60+ tools
and http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/toolsets/15+ toolsets
available on the ImageJ website (see sec:CustomToolsAndToolsets). 

All ImageJ Toolbartools share common features:
itemize
The images/tools/triangle  on the bottom right
corner of some icons in the toolbar depicts a contextual menu that
can be accessed by right-clicking on the tool icon (e.g., sub:StacksMenu).
If an 'Options' dialog is available for a particular tool, it can
be accessed by double clicking on the tool icon (e.g., sub:Wand-Tool).

Status barsub:Status-bar

When the cursor is over an image, pixel intensities and Coordinatescoordinates
are displayed in the Status barstatus bar. After running
a filter, elapsed time and processing rate (in pixels/second)
are also displayed. When clicking on the status bar the ImageJ version,
the Java version, MemoryRAM@RAM  Memory,memory
in use, memory available and percent memory used will be displayed.
As sec:Selections-Intro are created or resized, selection
properties (e.g., location, width, etc.) are displayed on the status
bar.

In addition, clicking on ImageJ's status bar, forces the
Java garbage collector to run, which may help to reclaim unused memory
(see EditOptionssub:Memory-=000026-Threads...).
You can assess this by running PluginsUtilitiessub:Monitor-Memory...:
each click on the Status bar should lead to a spike in the ImageJ's
memory utilization.

If a spatial scale has been defined in Imagesub:Image>Properties...
or Analyzesub:Set-Scale..., selection
properties are displayed in the sub:Status-bar in calibrated
units. Resizing or moving while holding down Alt forces
this information to be displayed in pixels.

Progress barsub:Progress-bar

The Progress barprogress bar, located to the right of the
status bar, shows the progress of time-consuming operations. It will
not appear if the operation requires less then approximately one second.
