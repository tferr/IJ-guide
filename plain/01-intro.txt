Getting Startedpart:Getting-Started

This part provides basic information on ImageJ installation, troubleshooting
and update strategies. It discusses sub:Fiji-introFIJIFiji Is Just ImageJ
and sub:ImageJ2intro as well as third-party software related
to ImageJ. Being impossible to document all the capabilities of ImageJ
without exploring technical aspects of image processing, external
resources allowing willing readers to know more about digital signal
processing are also provided.


Introductionsec:What-is-ImageJ?

ImageJ is a http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/disclaimer.htmlpublic domain
Java image processing and analysis program inspired by http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/NIH Image
for the Macintosh. It runs, either as an online applet or as a downloadable
application, on any computer with a Java1.5 or later virtual machine.
http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.htmlDownloadable distributions
are available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. It can display, edit,
analyze, process, save and print 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit images.
It can read many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, DICOM,
FITS and 'raw'. It supports 'stacks' (and hyperstacks), a series
of images that share a single window. It is multithreaded, so time-consuming
operations such as image file reading can be performed in parallel
with other operations(A somehow outdated list of ImageJ's features is available at http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/features.html).

It can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined selections.
It can measure distances and angles. It can create density histograms
and line profile plots. It supports standard image processing functions
such as contrast manipulation, sharpening, smoothing, edge detection
and median filtering.

It does geometric transformations such as scaling, rotation and flips.
Image can be zoomed up to 32:1 and down to 1:32. All analysis
and processing functions are available at any magnification factor.
The program supports any number of windows (images) simultaneously,
limited only by available memory.

Spatial calibration is available to provide real world dimensional
measurements in units such as millimeters. Density or gray scale calibration
is also available.

ImageJ was designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility
via Java plugins. Custom acquisition, analysis and processing plugins
can be developed using ImageJ's built in editor and Java compiler.
User-written plugins make it possible to solve almost any image processing
or analysis problem.

Being public domain open source software, an ImageJ user has the http://wikieducator.org/The_right_license/The_essential_freedomsfour essential freedoms
defined by the Richard Stallman in 1986: 1) The freedom to run the
program, for any purpose; 2) The freedom to study how the program
works, and change it to make it do what you wish; 3) The freedom to
redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor; 4) The freedom
to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public,
so that the whole community benefits.

ImageJ is being developed on Mac OSX using its built in editor
and Java compiler, plus the BBEdit editor and the Ant
build tool. The source code is freely http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/developer/source/index.htmlavailable.

Installing and Maintaining ImageJsec:Updating-ImageJUpdates

ImageJ can be downloaded from http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html.
Details on how to install ImageJ on Linuxhttp://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/linux.htmlLinux,
http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/mac.htmlMac OS 9,
Mac OS Xhttp://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/osx.htmlMac OS X
and Windows (OS)http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/windows.htmlWindows
C-WindowsInstaller are available at http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/install/
(Helpsub:Installation... command).
Specially useful are the platform-specific Troubleshooting
and Known Problems sections. Fijisub:Fiji-intro
installation is described at http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Downloads.

The downloaded package may not contain the latest bug fixes so it
is recommended to upgrade ImageJ right after a first installation.
UpdatesUpdating IJIJImageJ consists only
of running Helpsub:Update-ImageJ...,
which will install the latest http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/upgrade/ij.jar
in the ImageJ folder (on Linux and Windows) or inside the ImageJ.app
(on Mac OSX). 

Helpsub:Update-ImageJ... can
be used to upgrade (or downgrade) the ij.jar file to release
updates or daily builds. Release updates are announced frequently
on the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/notes.htmlIJ news website
and are labelled alphabetically (e.g., v.1.43m). Typically, these
releases contain several new features and bug fixes, described in
detail on the http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/notes.htmlImageJ News page.
Daily builds, on the other hand, are labelled with numeric
sub-indexes (e.g., v.1.43n4) and are often released without documentation.
Nevertheless, if available, release notes for daily builds can be
found at http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/source/release-notes.html.
When a release cycle ends (v.1.42 ended with 1.42q, v.1.43 with
1.43u, etc.) an installation package is created, downloadable
from http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html. Typically, this
package is bundled with a small list of add-ons (sub:Macros-ExtendingIJ,
sub:Scripts and sub:Plugins).

http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/toolsets/Luts20Macros20and20Tools20Updater.txtLuts, Macros and Tools Updater,
a macro toolset that performs live-updating of http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/macros
listed on the ImageJ web site


ImageJDistributionssec:ImageJ-Distributions

ImageJ alone is not that powerful: it's real strength is the vast
repertoire of sub:Plugins that extend ImageJ's functionality
beyond its basic core. The many hundreds, probably thousands,  freely
available plugins from contributors around the world play a pivotal
role in ImageJ's successCollins:2007p13684. Running Helpsub:Update-ImageJ...,
however, will not update any of the plugins you may have installed(Certain plugins, however, provide self-updating mechanisms (e.g.,
http://simon.bio.uva.nl/objectj/ObjectJ and the Bio-Formatshttp://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formatsOME Bio-Formats).).

ImageJ add-ons (sub:Plugins, sub:Scripts and
sub:Macros-ExtendingIJ) are available from several sources
(http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/ImageJ's plugins page
[Helpsub:Plugins...],
http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:startImageJ Information and Documentation Portal
and http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Category:PluginsFiji's webpage,
among others) making manual updates of a daunting task. This reason
alone, makes it extremely convenient the use of sec:ImageJ-Distributions
bundled with a pre-organized collection of add-ons.

Below is a list of the most relevant projects that address the seeming
difficult task of organizing and maintaining ImageJ beyond its basics.
If you are a life scientist and have doubts about which distribution
to choose you should opt for sub:Fiji-intro. It is heavily
maintained, offers an automatic updater, improved scripting capabilities
and ships with powerful plugins. More specialized adaptations of ImageJ
are discussed in sub:Other-Software-Packages.


Fijisub:Fiji-intro

http://fiji.sc/FijiFiji (Fiji Is Just ImageJ-Batteries
included) is a distribution of ImageJ together with Java, Java 3D
and several plugins organized into a coherent menu structure. Citing
its developers, "Fiji compares to ImageJ as Ubuntu compares to Linux".
The main focus of Fiji is to assist research in life sciences, targeting
image registration, stitching, segmentation, feature extraction and
3D visualization, among others. It also supports many scripting languages
(BeanScript, Clojure, Jython, Python, Ruby, see sec:ScriptingOtherLang).
Importantly, Fiji ships with a http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Update_Fijiconvenient updater
that knows whether your files are up-to-date, obsolete or locally
modified. http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/DocumentationComprehensive documentation
is available for most of its plugins. The Fiji project was presented
publicly for the first time at the http://imagejconf.tudor.lu/doku.phpImageJ User and Developer Conference
in November 2008.


MBF ImageJsub:MBFImageJintro

The MBF ImageJImageJ for Microscopy@ImageJ for Microscopy  MBF ImageJ,http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/MBF ImageJ bundle
or ImageJ for Microscopy (formerly http://www.uhnres.utoronto.ca/facilities/wcif/imagej/WCIF-ImageJ)
features a collection of plugins and macros, collated and organized
by Tony Collins at the MacBiophotonics facility, McMaster University.
It is accompanied by a http://www.macbiophotonics.ca/imagej/comprehensive manual
describing how to use the bundle with light microscopy image data.
It is a great resource for microscopists but is not maintained actively,
lagging behind the development of core ImageJ.

Note that you can add plugins from MBF ImageJ to Fiji, combining the
best of both programs. Actually, you can use multiple ImageJ distributions
simultaneously, assemble your own ImageJ bundle by gathering the plugins
that best serve your needs (probably, someone else at your institution
already started one?) or create symbolic links to share plugins between
different installations.

Using Mailing-lists

If you are having problems with ImageJ, you should inquiry about them
in the appropriated Help resourceslist. The ImageJ mailing
list is an unmoderated forum subscribed by a knowledgeable worldwide
user community with 2000 advanced users and developers.
To have your questions promptly answered you should consider the following:
enumerate
Read the documentation files (described earlier in this section) before
posting. Because there will always be a natural lag between the implementation
of key features and their documentation it may be wise to check briefly
the ImageJ news website (Helpsub:ImageJ-News...).
Look up the mailing list archives (Helpsub:List-Archives...).
Most of your questions may have already been answered.
If you think you are facing a Bug (reporting)@Bug (reporting) Debug,bug
try to upgrade to the latest version of ImageJ (Helpsub:Update-ImageJ...).
You should also check if you are running the latest version of the
Java Virtual Machine for your operating system. Detailed instructions
on how to submit a bug report are found at http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/faqs.html#bug.
Remember that in most cases you can find answers within your own ImageJ
installation without even connecting to the internet since the heuristics
for finding commands or writing macros have been significantly improved
in later versions (see sec:Finding-Commands and
sec:Extending-ImageJ).
As with any other mailing list, you should always follow basic http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquettenetiquette,
namely:

enumerate
Use descriptive subject lines - Re: Problem with Image>Set
Scale command is much more effective than a general Re: Problem.
Stay on topic - Do not post off-topic messages, unrelated to the
message thread.
Be careful when sending attachments - Refrain from attaching large
files. Use, e.g., a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_hosting_serviceComparison_of_notable_file_hosting_servicesfile hosting service
instead.
Edit replies - You should include only the minimum content that is
necessary to provide a logical flow from the question to the answer,
i.e., quote only as much as absolutely necessary and relevant.enumerate
