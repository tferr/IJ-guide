# The ImageJ User Guide
This repository contains all things related to the [ImageJ User Guide](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/).


## Typesetting
See [README](./README) for instructions on how to build the guide.


## Contributing
Want to contribute? Great! Here is what you can do:


### You have a concrete suggestion
Check that your proposal has not been mentioned [previously][issues]. Then, try one of the following:

  1. If you already use GitHub, create a new [issue][issues] or a [pull request][pulls]
  2. Otherwise, share it using the [IJ mailing list][list]. A simple subject line "_User Guide Suggestion: XX_" should work


### You’d like to help out but aren’t sure how
Looking for something to do? Great! Pick something that looks interesting from the [issues list][issues]. Then, use one of the approaches mentioned above


### You’d like to see alternative implementations of the guide
There are several programs capable of converting the guide TeX files into other formats, such as RTF, MediaWiki or markdown markup. E.g., [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) could be used to convert the guide into markdown:

       ## Aggregate all of the child documents into a single file
       latexpand ./user-guide.tex > guide.tex
       ## Ensure UTF-8 encoding
       iconv -f MACROMAN -t UTF-8 guide.tex > guide.tex
       ## Run pandoc
       pandoc -f latex -t markdown ./guide.tex > guide.md
